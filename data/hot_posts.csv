I told him let me speak with swiggy and come back.

I spoke with swiggy , with their non- sensical answers they told that order was cancelled  and asked me to keep the refund. I get the call from delivery agent to send money . I told him I am ready to pay it back to swiggy and asked him to arrange the call . He said it is not possible and asking me to pay him directly.
It got fishy , I told him I will pay only once I get my money comes into my account. His reaction entirely changed and started scolding me with bad words and threatening me.

He has my details phone number, name , the place I stay . I reported the same to swiggy they are giving their regular machine replies .

Here people have left their morals and trying to extort the money in anyway they can . I just want you all to know that this type of scam is going on so that you could be careful.

18,"How long is ""Gay"" going to be an insult?","I'm barely 17 but the fact that the people in my school shame/make fun of the classmates by calling them gay is really getting me on my nerves. I'm not gay but i feel bad for the people who are, for what they're going through - homophobia, insults, you name it. It's not just limited to the school, their behavior towards homosexual people reflects in every single aspect of life. Like, they're unable to accept the fact that a man can fall in love with a man. 

This is how a gay insult usually happens in my classroom

Guy1: hey wazzup man! long time no see eh?

Guy2: (comes closer to shake hands/greet)

Guy3: (a moron, outta nowhere) hey, Guy2 is gay!!!!

Guy1: SHEEEEEEESH I'm not fucking coming closer to you. don't even touch me you homosexual scumbag!! (runs away as if he's running for his life)

I don't know if this is happening in other schools, or even places in general. I feel this should have been nipped in the bud. But this prevails due to poor quality of education and upbringing of children.

How the heck is India going to develop at this rate? no wonder why Indians are leaving for foreign countries (like i said, i'm barely 17 and this is my perspective)

19,indian stance on ukraine is morally wrong but ok by international politics.," copying the answer byu/nejxhnake8hfaj and Dense-Throat-5371 because it is exactly my view as well .. I'm pasting his comment here. also the link.. https://np.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t2gm19/india_turns_down_us_persuasion_to_vote_against/hym5n6c/

those who say india did wrong.. please read. You would not be making this comment if you knew about the history. India did the absolutely right thing in this situation.

Russia has been the only ally if India in its trying times, when India was invaded by Pakistan in 1971, where were the US and the NATO countries? Oh right, they were busy supplying arms and ammunition to the AGGRESSOR (Pakistan) in this situation. Russia was the only country that helped us during this time.Times and times the west has ostracized India and refused to help. During the recent skirmishes in the Sino-Indian war, did you see a single nation in the west concerned about us. They told us it's our own internal matter to be dealt with. And now that India doesn't want to participate in a war that would cause a huge loss to them, suddenly they are bad? What hypocrites

Let's move onto geopolitics now, India has Pakistan to it's west and China to it's north, both of them have bad relations with India, now if we vote against Russia our only ally, wouldn't this turn Russia against us as well. Trust me, you don't want three war mongering nations, with nuclear weapons nonetheless, after you.

In addition to this, Russia is the biggest fertilizer supplier to India. India's huge part of economy depends on it's agricultural industry, which is maintained only because the supply of fertilizers from Russia. Now tell me, if we go against Russia and they decided to stop any trade with us, wouldn't it affect India's economy severely? We would literally starve, and I doubt the west will give any fucks about us as if they have given any in the past. United Snakes of America (not an insult to the people but to the government) can't be trusted at all.

You cannot be emotionally driven in your decisions when you have A BILLION people in your country to look after. Trust me, Indians, too, don't want a war, our heart goes to the soldiers of Russia, Ukraine and the poor citizens who got caught in crossfire, but we can't do much, we have already done all we can. And I am sure the diplomats who took this decision surely knows a lot about this topic than me and you*

Well yes. You are indeed correct. But India has 74 years of relations established with Russia. Whereas, with the US we have started establishing major relations for a decade only.

No offense but from a complete political standpoint, India knows it can trust Russia and not someone like US who was responsible (the Nixon Administration) for supporting Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistan war which heavily severed our relations and also terror-funding in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

India is trying its best to go through a middle ground here. Yes, it will look like we are condoning Putin's war crimes but do we truly have a choice here?

Given the past, we cannot trust the west. We can't just outright ""betray"" Russia and make a nuclear power an enemy which is just located above our head. Not to mention, we will also be potentially going against China ( which is pro-Russian in this) and Pakistan (Pro-Russian and heavily influenced by China) and would be left completely bordered.

Just a note, I'm talking about everything from a political point of view and not morally

..
also our first priority is safety of india as a nation and its citizens and for that we need good allys.. tell me what in the opinion of governemtn of india shoudl be a preference... thinking about our own citizens and our nation, or caring about some other nation.. i think our own people come in first priority and then the other nations.. so even if we dont give anti russia or pro russia  statements.. best least we can do it keep mouth shut.

also count the numebr of times ukraine voted against india and the times russia supported us and even used veto for us.",53,Foreign Relations,87cac512-1d08-11eb-ad0b-0e5e270e4ce5,55

I noticed that a lot of men in the east and northeast go for stubbles or clean shaves. I noticed this in the north as well. This is the popular pattern for people living north of the vindhya line.

I noticed that South Indians, including Maharashtrians tend to go for a proper moustache with a clean or light beard, or they go for a full curly beard (since most of them have curly/wavy hair). Those curly beards look tough.

As they grow their personalities change the poor girl becomes angry and jealous and I think other girl was rude and snobbish.

The poor girl travels with rich girl to her wedding, the husband of rich girl either falls for poor girls charms or violates her? 

I was probably way to young to see this movie but parents never really cared lol

Because I already have one, I'm assuming not, but they get renewed when you turn 20 and you have to keep passport photos up to date untill 50.

So the question I have is, If I were so inclined would it be possible to join the military while also keeping my OCI card? Again, it's a big hypothetical, I would crumble in the military haha.

62,[VENT] Regarding recent events.,"Indian right-wing cheering Russia's unjustified Invasion is absolutely sickening. I understand that India's neutral stance on this issue which in my opinion is correct one, but the way some chaddis and Unkils are demonizing west and praising Putin's agression is ruining our image on international stage.

My family Whatsapp group is already flooded with (incorrect)facts about how Russia is right and India also should do same with Bangladesh and missile all Muslims. Most of my family doesn't even know what NATO is , one of my aunt was saying that its a Christian missionary org. and Putin is saving Russia from them(seriously). Now they have started cherry picking isolated events to prove who Ukraine is as Anti-India as Pakistan or China and Modi was played another masterstroke by supporting Russia(He hasn't).

India absolutely cannot afford to have bad relations with USA or EU they are our largest export partner about 32% combined . IT is only sector which is creating somewhat enough amount of jobs,(Another Masterstroke by Mudi !!!) relies on these countries , most Indians aboard do higher studies in these countries adding to that we were in talks with EU for FTA (Not sure what will happen to that now). Good luck turning India into a developed without support of wealthy western countries. Russian economy hasn't had any real growth is a decade at this point we can't trust them for our economic ambitions by any means. Every One In India wants India to become a global power with respect at world stage but no one understands that its impossible without a strong economy.

Lets be honest Most Indians especially those from right-wing side are fucking delusional about our power on international stage ,they think Modi has turned India into some hyperpower whose opinion is listened by every country.

64,"Please hear me out, I'll really appreciate.","I am a 21 year old female, currently in 3rd of my B.Tech degree in chemical engineering in a very popular college in Tamilnadu (Not SRM). I got 8.18 GPA in my first semester, I worked hard but somehow got this much only. From second semester i found engineering sort of really hard, that's when we were all called back home due to COVID. Gave the final exams of that semester online and scored 8.14 GPA. For the consecutive semesters, the subjects kept getting harder but in the name of cheating only wrote theory questions from either Teacher's uploaded PPT or whatever I could remotely found related in Google since it was open book, for the numerical part, i always did them myself.

But the students who were scoring 5 GPA in offline, started scored 8.5+ GPA in online and i could never understand why. 3rd semester - GPA - 8.13
It got so much worse in 4th semester, i got 7.82 GPA, despite getting 80+ marks in most subjects. Since the relative grading fucked so many things up.

Got depressed, took more credits than I can handle and with the help of Chegg for 1-2 subjects, scored 8.11 GPA in the 5th semester. (Still very less, got B grade in 91 marks)

I have done many other things In college, published one review article, worked on so many others, 2 of them might get published by the time I graduate, others just got abandoned. 
I earned some money in a management role internship. Did an offline internship last year and training in a lab of other college, learned a foreign Language.

This semester the subjects are the toughest and the college is going to reopen in the middle (next week). So I'll have to give rest of the exams offline. The minimum I can afford to score is 7.62 in order to keep my CGPA atleast 8.0.

I am planning to do my masters in an asian country like either China, Singapore, Japan etc. But my confidence is hanging by a thread. I work hard, pay attention in classes, do my assignments myself but still scoring Less. If you have any advice on as to how to land in a good University on masters, and what can I do to compensate for my GPA please comment. 
Thank you :(

65,Diplomacy depends on not just the Government but the media and public too?,"  I think India's diplomacy regardless who's in power hasn't been bad, with an exception to some minor blunders. I feel a good amount of it, depends not on just the Government but the media and general public too.

  We get really emotional over everything. We also have a tendency to boast and exaggerate about things we do. The hyper-nationalism doesn't help at all. We have seen this with Nepal, with how the media messed everything up, even though we were the one sending aid. We aren't well-liked in general and these things make it worse.

  If you at the Japanese, they seemed to be well-liked. Japan was the worst when it came to war-crimes during WW2, not that the current public should be blamed for it. But they do actively tend to deny them. Yet, the perception of Japan is good in western eyes. I've seen staunch liberals who criticized Japan over their denial, do a 180 because of anti-China sentiment. Korean government invests a lot in K-pop and movies as a means of Diplomacy. If I'm not wrong, bollywood was really popular with Russians in the past. 

  Now, I'm not saying we should lick western boots. The past few days have shown us the west doesn't care about anyone other than itself, worse it doesn't even consider us friends. It'll even make an out of us for it's own gain. 

  And that is exactly why we have to be careful. Reacting unnecessary with no thought won't help us at all. The subreddit of our much dumber other half is already going crazy. I've seen a lot of pro-Russian and anti-Ukraine messages and memes from WhatsApp University, these will be posted on twitter making the situation worse.

I've tried many many other things but reading and writing were things I constantly enjoyed. It all stopped when I entered 9th and my parents enrolled me in my school's engineering exam prep program.(I tried hard to say no but my father shut me down with- ""You should really study and build a career, even if you don't, I have enough money to get you married off."" That one seriously hurt) After that I wasn't able to write as much(due to the academic pressure and trying to perform) but still continued to read a lot.

See my parents' point of view is, since writing has a weak monetary prospect and huge instability, I should first pursue a main career and then keep writing as a secondary once I am settled. Because of that I was never able to practice my skills or enter competitions(although I believe I should have tried harder).

Now, I like Maths, I really do but I don't think I love it as much, and so every time I open my book I think of it as a burden.

108,My neighbors poisoned my cats,"In Aligarh in a society my next door neighbors used to scare, beat and run after my cats everywhere they saw them  I just used to ignore them as they would start doing it more just to tease me this was going on for the laat couple of years but since the past week they started to fight with me regarding the cats even then I wouldn't fight with them and would say that if they don't like them they can keep them away from their garden but except that it's not their property they can freely roam around and go wherever they want. Just 5 days after they threatened us that we will kill your cats just like they had previously brutally killed a dog in the society a few weeks back. Just few days after One of my 4 month old cat passed away and the other 7 months old is severly ill. The kitten had vomiting just for one day which was only white mucus and the other one had the same symptoms from what we made out they were given poison or some kind of deadly chemical. How can I take action against them what can I do to bring justice to the poor small animal as these people are not stoping first they killed a dog then cats and what now humans?

As I was writing this a message came on the colony group that tomorrow a meeting will be held to make rules and regulations for stray cats and dogs from what they have done till now the rules are gonna be beat stray dogs with sticks till they die and poison the cats cause that's the solution they have.

Edit:- They were kittens that a cat gave near my house and I just started feeding and gave shelter to the family I already have about 10 cats indoor which never ever go out so stop saying I am not responsible I have the responsibility of so many cats who live inside my house and never step outdoor. I was just helping the poor cats outside they were not my pet that I got for my entertainment and left them outside.",256,Crime,a4b368ae-6655-11ec-8f46-de0cfdda1277,113

120,Neighbour threatens to cut water line. What can I do?,"For context, I live on rent in a 3 storied apartment building (in Delhi) where I reside on the second floor. The other two floors are owned by two families. The owner of my flat, i.e. my landlord lives a few buildings away.

A few days back, my neighbour who resides on the first floor, complained that her ceiling was getting damp, presumably because of water seeping from the second floor's pipes. I conveyed the same to my landlord, who asked me to tell my neighbour to get it fixed and he'll pay all plumbers fees and charges. 

When I informed my neighbour the same, she said that she won't do that and my landlord needs to fix it by himself asap. I then asked her to have a conversation with my landlord on the phone, so that they can reach to some mutual understanding. She refused and said that she'll keep pestering me only until my landlord fixes it. That evening I called my landlord and conveyed the message. He said he'd come to our apartment and deal with it. However, he didn't. The next few days were quiet. 

Today my neighbour came up to my floor again, and again started shouting on me that why isn't it fixed and threatened that she'll cut our water line. I calmly replied that I'll talk to my landlord again.

I called my landlord, informed him all this, asked him to come meet this neighbour and sort it out, and he replied he'll try to come or at the very least, he'll definitely send a plumber today to fix it.

I'm not sure whether he'll look into it but I definitely don't want to loose out on my water connection. So please advice if I can do anything in this case, as I'm stuck between two parties who aren't willing to resolve the issue within themselves. And can someone actually cut someone else's water line without legal repercussions?

Btw, the water connection line is accessible only in the water pump's compartment which is locked and only the 3 flat owners have keys to it.",11,Law & Courts,687b3904-6082-11eb-af80-0e41d1ca0be9,6

Only silver lining for them is that their YoY revenue is increasing and losses are decreasing.

How many of you are still working in the field. I keep hearing bad things about choosing to study biotech. What I've heard till now is it's a dead field in India. Big pharma/biotech companies only operate in India for the cheap labour costs. Is that true? Apparently there is no real research happening in India. How true is that? Is everyone leaving the country to settle abroad? What kind of salaries are you guys getting. Apparently it's hard to even crack double digits (10lpa) in India and six figures abroad even after 10 years of experience (heard this from a relative who's friend is in a similar situation apparently). I have been lurking on reddit for a few months now and i keep seeing/hearing about exorbitant salaries of software engineers.  All my relatives are discouraging me from choosing this field.

(Why discuss it cause it is important)

The Ukraine, NATO and Russia situation:- 

It may be me but after watching what NATO has done throughout history, does Putin actually has any other choice. NATO destroyed Libya and Iraq taking advantage of their home chaos. Here is a photo of NATO expansion 

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2zweumc9ahk81.gif

Fast forward to 2022 now this is NATO:-

Russia is just literally being surrounded by two sides.

NATO on paper and NATO actually:-

Let's talk about QUAD, on paper QUAD is made for business and home diplomatic relationships, but we Indian all know that it is made to counter China may not be a NATO level but still.

The role of America in all of this:- 

We all know right now America has two main enemies Russia and China. One is getting weaker and one is getting stronger with it. And history has told us America only know two things Power and oil. India case of Russia, it has the world's most natural gas storage:- [https://www.worldometers.info/gas/gas-reserves-by-country/](https://www.worldometers.info/gas/gas-reserves-by-country/)

America has sanctions every country that has Natural oil reserved and don not bow to America example Iran and Libya many more.

Part of Ukraine:-

Ukraine is played by the West to get a reason against Russia in favour of them. They have done this against it much time but Russia is a superpower they are not able to fight it straight away. Ukraine is attacked by Russia only when it has shown interest to join NATO. What happening with Ukraine people is devastating but Russia never attacked Belarus pretty a chance that will not attack Ukraine if it does not want to join NATO.

Role of India:-

We need the USA to counter China but blindly following the west is the biggest mistake we can do. Cause America is power-hungry after finishing Russia, China their next target will be India. Cause though they do not militarily fight them but slowed down Japan and Germany's economy and make sure they don't surpass its economy. And countering China India is not alone in Asia, there are examples like Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, Indonesia. As far as I know India, Vietnam also hate China but has a pretty good relationship with Russia. India need good relationships with countries like this in the field of military cooperation

My final thought;-

I am devastated watching normal civilians of Ukraine but does Putin has any other choice. He is not pure at all, he is a dictator but I do not think he is a mad one. NATO has left him no other choice. I am not pro-Russian but I will accept I have some sympathy over Russia how it saved India in 1971 when two NATO country was ready to attack India. And also personally I hate America cause it not only destroyed the middle east but also East Africa.

Now, I think this situation is not very good for India in the long term.

The sanctions being imposed on Russia will push it further into China's orbit as it now needs to do business with China even more than before, it does business with India as well but any sane country would ditch India as a business partner in favor of the much wealthier China any day. 

Also this situation has got the ball rolling, it won't result in any massive conflict in the short term but it's ripple effects can very easily result in a massive conflict in a decade or two.

In this case, India is completely encircled. [This is what I think the map of the war would look like](https://imgur.com/a/mN2HMgz) though I could be wrong here. But this is simply a nightmarish scenario for us.

India can't handle a prolonged war with China alone, we can handle a short quick war but we can't handle a long with China, and in this situation we might have to face a two front assault from both Pakistan and China and even maybe Russia.

If we couldn't handle it, the Punjab and the Doab region may get overrun by foreign troops and we might have to retreat into the deccan to continue resistance or surrender.

India needs to buy as many weapons we can, we need to standardize our weaponry and make them compatible with each other, we need to set up a huge military industrial complex to support a prolonged war if it comes to that. We need to start our own RND, we need to do whatever we can to make it out of this century intact.

In my opinion this is an extremely dangerous position we are into and I am very worried.

When I read a detailed article explaining the NSE scandal (credits to The Hindu) there was a brief mention of NSEL. I linked it up with what I briefly read in the book which linked former Finance minister of UPA and the present NSE chairman as being responsible or colluded with the corrupt brokers. It also states that the whole scam was a farce and was a well planned sabotage to help the maintain the monopoly of the share market.

So basically i do not  want to get married after outweighing pros and cons of it.
I’m 24 now almost 25 and. I am afraid that if I’m  nearing 30 , parents or relatives can induce anxious/anxiety thoughts and make me rethink about it causing a dilemma especially with dialogues of “you will regret this decision later in life and it will be too late then”

Tbh,  don’t think I can take up that level of responsibility that usual Indian society expect a man to take on,

Also I don’t really fit in to the  typical arranged marriage and family scene, have seen my friends do it,  really don’t think that’s my scene at all!

These are middle class kids who have gone abroad to study during a war. They aren't taking any sides and they (and their families) don't deserve this stupid pain over a white man's war that India has nothing to do with.  
 
It is 100% not their fault or responsibility to have not fled Ukraine or their cities/universities during the lead up to the war - money doesn't grow on trees and everything was uncertain a week ago. Putin was supposed to invade at 4 am on one day, then 4 am on another day, and so on.  
  
I understand Europeans being too harebrained and racist to sympathize with Indians (and Africans and Pakistanis) caught in this dilemma, but I don't understand why the government is not publicly appealing to Russia and Ukrainian forces to provide safe passage to non-nationals who are not involved in this.  
  
Whichever party helps India will win a huge wave of support in India for sure. If the Ukrainians guarantee safe passage to Indian nationals, then the Modi government will be hard pressed to explain why they're still teetering towards Russia.  
  
If Russia helps them, then they've once again won us over as a staunch ally for the next 40 years.

192,Indian controlling parents,"Hello, so I am (25F) living in United states from last 4 and half years. 
I came first to do MBA after graduating in June 2019, I wanted to work and my parents wanted me to come back. They gave me 3 months to look for a job or pack my bags and come back. After 2 months into the time limit my mom and started calling me everyday to book my tickets to come back. They would fight with me and tell me “its enough, you couldn’t do anything in 2 months, what will another month change”. They booked a ticket and sent it to me. I couldn’t focus on anything after that as they would still call me and trouble me.

I went back to India like they wanted, I was so unhappy I would constantly fight with my boyfriend (who I left in US for my parents) everyday because of that. I did everything I could and convinced my parents that I want to go back to study more. I took an admission again in a new university for a second masters applied for a visa again did the entire process again however at that time my parents were only willing to let me go on the condition that I will come back as soon as I complete my second masters. So by February 20 20 I managed to come back to United States now Fastrak two years later my parents want me to come back and I don’t want to go back.
In the two years I’ve been here after 2020 I have a good job I am a management am at the management level position where I run the entire company and it means absolutely nothing to my parents when I tell them I would have to leave my job and come and they say that “ yeah so what just say that you’re not gonna be working with them anymore and come back to India” I make so much money right now that I would never be able to make it at any position in India but they don’t care about that they say me on the money is not a priority since I am a daughter they would much rather be happier if I come back to them and sit with them at home and do nothing till they can find somebody for me to get married. They believe that getting married is the next best step of success and progress I can take in my life. My financial independence or success means absolutely nothing since it’s not their requirement it’s mine.
They say “will let you study as much as you wanted and to make you happy but I think that’s about it you lived your life as much as you want it now you can come back do your life in India“
Growing on me and my mom had a lot of fights and issues every time they found out that I had a boyfriend they would beat me up fight with me keep me locked in the house not let me go we meet with friends or anything keep calling on me checking on me again and again when i would be out in college. She would spy on me check on me take my phone at night till I was 19 or 20 years old till I left my parents house to come to US they did not yet we keep my phone at night with me.
They do not believe that the education I have received is for a better use or a better future for myself that is just a back up in case down the line somewhere in my married life I have to support my husband I can as a back up security baby but if I want to work it will be dependent on the person I get married to
Now I’m at a position where they keep calling me ask again to ask me when will I book a ticket to come back to them and I just don’t know how to convince them that I don’t want to come back my mom keeps calling me and messaging me emotional thanks and it hurts but I just cannot go back I might too selfish for not wanting to go back to life that they want.
What do I do?

Edit: I finally told my parents yesterday, I did not have the courage to say if everything on their face so I sent both of them a text message and waited for them to read it and call me back. Since then I haven’t spoken to my dad, I had a 5 to 6 hour long fight with my mom where is she clearly said that I have to choose between my dreams on my family and it is absurd to her that how their dreams are not mine. In the text message I said “marraige is not for me” to that my mom’s response was “did you get married already? Or what did you do wrong that you dont want to get maaried, because not being ready for it is BS”
I tried so hard to explain her and show my point of you but clearly she said that “no matter what you say I wouldn’t be able to understand you because I don’t want to and I don’t care, money is the only thing that is important for you and I can keep building or filling up my closets with money she wouldn’t care because I would always be alone”. She believes that no matter how much we study or how much I studied it was all for my happiness because I wanted it and all this is so if I need some thing down the line in my future I can take care of myself but not build some thing from the beginning and be independent I don’t need to do that according to her, She thinks we study for yours and yours only to work for a year after that to gain some experience and then get married and figure out if the other family would want me to work. 
Apparently following my dreams meant that I have betrayed her if I don’t go back Like I promise 2 years ago before I came To the US again. 
She expects me to put a timeline and make a promise on everything I do two years ago I don’t know where I was going to be, I don’t know what I’m going to be in the next two years, one thing I know where I am now and I just don’t understand how following your dreams would be a betrayal. She even has a condition that if I come back I need to be happy I have to be happy she would not be OK if I come back and be sad, I cannot even return on my own terms. She said so many times that I am killing her I’m getting my father I’m killing my grandfather because of the decision i chose. My dad is not answering my call and my mom keeps telling me that “he will not talk to you ever again he’s just crying”. I feel so bad should I just go back and not hold them like this and just pretend to be happy so they can be happy maybe then I don’t know.",5,Rant / Vent,dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418,11
193,Ukrainian soldier beating Indian students is wrong but should a country be judged based on this?,"Imagine a enemy country was trying to invade India (God forbid) without provocation and some foreign students from less developed countries were being beaten at the border by security forces for whatever reason. Would you want other countries changing their opinion of India based on this? It is wrong but unfortunately happens sometimes during desperate times.

Ok, So I don't know how this happened. The messages that my father forwarded to my mother all were the same. Like it was our CM dressed like a Terrorist with Gun.

Like every message he sent was changed into that and sent. I checked if he installed any app without discrete knowledge or something. Like if he sends good morning, it shows fine at his side but on my mothers phone or my phone or any other it shows as MKstalins photo.

But in installed apps there was nothing suspicious. I cannot wrap my head around it Idk if someone intentionally installed some malware into his without his knowledge or something.

Now I have cleared the data and cache of whatsapp and now the messages sent are fine but the above mentioned issue is very suspicious.

197,I think most Indians were born or brought up to be slaves and there's nothing much to be proud of in our recent history.,"First it was under King's and putting up with their abuse. The constant infighting left us weak and British invaded . Let's be honest, why wouldn't you invade a country that is divided, very wealthy and led by trash who were constantly at each other's throats? Even the Americans were united and those people had more reasons than us to be divided and yet they managed to fight the British off when they were at full power and a dominant force. It took india ages by comparison to achieve independence and no thanks to a pervert and lunatic like ghandi. The British government was bankrupt during that time and was giving up colonies left, right and center. India would have gotten it's freedom no matter what at that point thanks their demise. After that we got Nehru, who is Socialist filth that ruined the country with is low iq mind. Indians during that time were jobless, starving and looking to flee the country. Then came indra gandhi who wanted to be a dictator, luckily that didn't happen. Today india is rampant with corruption thanks to Socialist policies which keep the poor uneducated and useless. Jobs are still low and Indian leave the country if they get a chance. Indias brain drain is so bad that people move to other capitalist countries the first chance they get. Tbh india hasn't done anything useful when compared to other nations and the people bend down to their elected dictators. Other Asian nations with more capitalist policies shot forward in just a few decades while India is still begging for companies to enter Indian Market.",0,Rant / Vent,dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418,7

211,Is it the right time for India to try to stop the war?,"Now that the West is really pushing Russia through sanctions and it's evident Russia can't decisively subdue Ukraine in another week's time with reinforcements coming in (unless Putin literally nukes the country which he can if cornered enough), both Modi and Xi have the opportunity and responsibility to pitch in and persuade Putin to stop and sit at the table of discussion. Russia has already done enough infrastructural damage to Ukraine in 3 days that would take years to rebuild.

When Putin invaded from 3 sides he thought it would take a couple of days to bring Ukraine to their knees. But he underestimated the bravery of Ukrainians. These brave people deserve a chance. Not many countries have people like that. Take Afghanistan and their former leadership, for example.

India can't force, but it can definitely start talking sense to Putin. Modi has a real shot at establishing himself as a world leader and that goes in line with the Indian history, culture and heritage. That would put us in a more acceptable position with the West as well as Russia which is in caution zone economicially. Modi can do that. And the time is now.

People who compare Ukraine and Pakistan are living in a fool's world. Pakistan is a nuclear-power where democracy is at the mercy of the military. That's not Ukraine. Ukraine's dilemma is whether to hold hands with the devil in the West or the East. That's a pitiful position. Put yourself at the position of Zelenskyy with a divided country and sandwiched between two major powers.

Silently watching a significantly weaker nation (in terms of military) fight alone (whatever may be the reason... Ukraine's history has been highly unstable, they deserve a chance to a better tomorrow) and get wiped for all the wrong reasons is a crime. Putin is ex-KGB and that instinct tilts him towards a win at any cost over the cost of human lives. India isn't that. Our leaders shouldn't become that. History won't forgive us if we let Putin continue doing this and do nothing about it when we can definitely be more active than abstaining from voting or remaining indifferent. We should make a real effort.

Maybe that's why you need a powerful opposition in democracy. I wonder why no opposition leader is pushing for continued talks with Russia towards ending this manslaughter.

229,"I [M28, Indian] am going through a bad breakup, due to arranged marriage"," This may be a long post, any help and comments are appreciated.

I \[M28\] met this girl \[F25\] (let's call her Nisha) at the office in Feb 2019 I was in a relationship that ended by the end of 2019 (due to reasons unrelated), technically Nisha and I didn't meet we were both in different cities of India working for the same project. As I was leaving that project Nisha was my replacement for a project she was freshly graduated and I was responsible for training her so our friendship began.  
I was dealing with my previous breakup till like Feb of 2020 (was pretty emotional too), then the pandemic started and we all were working from home. Mind you Nisha and I were not working in the same company, we were in different cities and never met but were occasionally talking on Whatsapp. Whenever Nisha has any difficulties in her office work she used to text me and generally that is what we used to talk about. I used to help her as a friend first but gradually started developing feelings (anyone would she is beautiful and sweet) but didn't tell her cuz we never met.  
By the end of 2020, we were talking on the phone more than usual and on 31st Dec 2020, I confessed my feeling, to which to my surprise I received a positive response. But at that time she made it clear let's not fall in love because her family is very conservative and won't allow marrying a boy from a different caste, state, and one who speaks a different language (my mother tongue is Marathi hers is Hindi). But still, we were in love somehow and I was a bit hopeful and stupid too, though I will manage because considering her brother managed to marry out of caste and had a love marriage.  
Things get complicated now, after 6 months of such a relationship we were closer than ever though we never met and she was also dependent on me for her daily office work as I will guide her in studies or stuff. But in the background, it was depressing also because there were thoughts in her and my mind that we will not be able to live together because of her family issues and I was losing hope. Then she changed her job and joined an organization in a city where I'll live once WFH is over (which is still not over). For both of us, it was clear that 2022 will be a year when we will have to break up. Still, we wanted to meet for once, so we did it met for a week in Nov 2021 for the first time after knowing each other for almost 2.5 years and 10 months of a relationship, it was a good time. There were some issues but that shit happens.  
During this whole time, my family had asked me to get married but somehow I made excuses and never listened to them and asked for time. Now that time is over and I will have to get married in 2022 (this may sound weird to people from western counties or even for some Indians but where I come from I need to think of this also, there are a lot of things depending on my marriage and it's a big thing for my parents also). So I ask Nisha to talk to her parents so that something can be done (she knew this was coming we had talked about it earlier also), but she says she won't be able to because there is no talk of her marriage in her house and she is afraid to ask and I understand that coming from very conservative and misogynist family that can be very difficult. My family knew about my relationship but we never talked about it openly. But they would have agreed for Nisha's, and my marriage would have taken some convincing.

After listening to Nisha's response that she can not talk to her family about me also she said ""**you should do whatever is best for you don't think about me**"" that would be hard for her but again our relationship is not going anywhere with this. So I decided I'll say yes to my family to arrange marriage which they were already preparing for without my yes (I know this is kind of selfish of me but it was difficult to wait for a girl who is not able to discuss me with her family and even if she asks after a year or two there is less than 5% chance that her family will agree). Also saying yes to arranged marriage was not easy for me I cried a lot alone, went through a lot of things alone could not tell her about all of this.  
As soon as I said yes to arrange marriage on 1st Jan 2022 I informed Nisha and she didn't ask me to revert my decision or anything but said the same thing do whatever is best for you. I told Nisha then we should not be in a relationship because if we are in a relationship I will not be able to focus on the arranged marriage thing I will feel like betraying someone or other. But this breakup was not the same as my previous one, Nisha is dependent on me for a lot of things in her life as well as work. So I wanted to support her as a friend through our breakup and afterward. So I suggested we should not stop talking but will reduce talking gradually and we'll behave as friends and no love thing. This is a very difficult and maybe a bad thing for a lot of you but I thought it will be difficult for her to manage without me so I didn't think it was right to break friendship also.  
But things are not going well since then, I am talking and met a girl (let's call her Mina) and probably will be marrying her. I am not in love with her but there is no reason I reject her in arrange marriage situation so I am considering this possibility of marrying Mina which can be good for me and my family. I have made clear to Nisha about this also, but she is not able to deal with it, she now says I could have waited for her and I was not in love with her I was using her. She says how can someone stop loving someone suddenly like this. I haven't stopped loving her, but I can not show my love to her if I am going to marry someone else, and Nisha also did nothing to stop me when I was asking.  
I still talk with Nisha when she calls (rarely I will call her) because I can not leave her alone I want things to be better, and I feel she needs my support. But if we are not going to marry and I am going to marry someone else things will change and I am not going to show boyfriend-like love to Nisha to give her false hopes. There has been a lot of fights with Nisha since last month over the phone but nothing seems to do any better. I suggested we should talk with a relationship counselor so that things can be better and it's easy to move on but he is not ready to do that also. I am also not in a good mental state right now there is a lot of pressure related to work, things with Nisha and parents pushing for arranged marriage I am so tired of all this. She wants me to behave normally but I don't know anymore how to behave normally.  
I don't want to play a victim here not I think she is and I am writing this as unbiased as possible, but circumstances led to this situation no one is at fault IMO. So tell me anything you feel about this, please.",19,Non Political,8f105a84-7ea0-11e3-bba1-12313b0c91be,60

One analyst said that this is in part due to the rampant corruption and outdated tactics of the Russian military.  


This made me ponder about the state of the Indian military, as we share a lot of hardware and also training, exercises, etc. with the Soviet and Russian military.

However I seldom get calls. While I do currently work in a tiny niche I have been applying for similar roles in very closely related fields only. In the past year I have only gotten through to at least one phone interaction like 5 times (assuming 1 application sent each day that's like 365+ apps).

My current CV exceeds 3 pages in length and this is something a close friend opined may have worked against me. I also recently read typical CV length should be upto 2-3 pages.

My CV has the following sections in that order -

Overview (4 small paras) > Skills > Objective (a small para) > Education (tabular form wid columns for qualification, institute, board/uni, year and grade) > Experience (detailed overview of my current role, also 1st job) > Internship (3 listed along with description) > Projects (3 with description, all during my PG) > Extra curric (4 listed).

Is it info overkill, especially for someone with as little experience as me? Should I remove entire sections (possibly shorten the overview section)? I read yesterday tabular info is to be avoided at all costs so should I reformat the education section (and possibly remove say my board exam scores as they're not the most recent)?

236,Swiggy Delivery Executive Scam,"Anyone with contacts with swiggy please forward this. I hope this helps swiggy in hiring and maintaining better delivery executive. Below is the mail I wrote to them.

&#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello,

I just want to make sure you are aware of the frauds that are happening recently by your delivery executives.

What made me write this email is that this happened to me multiple times in the last few months and this time I had proof.

Coming to the point. I made an order on swiggy from BurgerKing on 26/02/2022 at 11:47pm Order# 128974641313. At around 1:00 am I get a call from the helpline saying that the delivery executive has met with an accident and won't be able to deliver my order. After asking to connect me with the executive, I asked the delivery guy if I can personally come and pick up the order from him at his location. He denied saying that the order is completely ruined and he is on his way to the hospital.

Upon further asking him to provide me with pictures of the scene, He sent me this image(attached with the mail). You can clearly see that the order is in perfect condition except that he took the order out from the bag and neatly placed it on the ground.

Proof 1 - The Choco lava cake is literally upright and the box that it came with is upside down. Weird isn't it?

Proof 2 - Burger is neatly placed outside the box with no signs of damage. Accidents won't leave such fragile products with zero damage.

Proof 3 - The fries inside the 3rd box are not at all damaged?

How is everything outside the packaging but with zero signs of damage?

Even after asking him to provide me with pictures of the accident or himself. He didn't reply back at all.

I hope someone from the support department actually sees this email and it's not just lost otherwise.

I did not want to write this email but I had to because YOU LOST A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER TODAY swiggy.

I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else in the future.

With not so warm regards,

Sarthak Mishra

My mother in law is two faced. 

My father in law is not going to say anything.

May be I’ll kill myself, may be I’ll run away. We’ll see how it goes. 

May be life is just an end-less sadness one way or other.

However there is this takeaway outlet in my city from which we order often, say every other week (i.e. 2-3 times a month) and they always use Dalda to cook our most common order (Chicken Mughlai Paratha, everything else in oil). 

Idk the reason prolly that it consumes a lot of oil which can't be later used to cook other stuff. 

I definitely sense a distinct chemical-esque taste every time we have it and my tongue also feels coated with a cooled wax like substance after a few bites.

Given our increased frequency of orders last night we resolved to supply them oil next time we order. As in my father asked if he'd price it lower given we were paying for the oil etc and he agreed.

What are your thoughts? Is 1 in every 45 meals (assuming once every fortnight) cooked in Dalda already worrisome?

A few days ago I had call with a distant relative over this topic. She was totally against the UK. The reasons she citied were, hard to get PR, strict 20 hours/week work time, and the said the job market in Canada is better. 

I am now very much confused. 
My requirements are: 

1. I want to stay back at-least for a few years (5-10) so that I am able to get a good return on investment on my MBA as well as get good work experience and save well. And I am open to settle permanently as well if there is an opportunity. So not necessarily getting a PR is not a deal breaker for me. But I should be able to stay back and work for some time.

2. Canada’s weather haunt me. 

3. I am not looking to making loads of money while I am studying. I want to focus on my grades. The money should be enough to pay my rent and expenses while I study. 

4. Career opportunities.

290,"Solo trip ideas for a shy, anxious, depressed 21 year old guy?","So, My life is pretty much a mess right now. I have taken some very poor decisions in my life and I am filled with regret. I have been holed up in my room from the past 3 years with bare minimum interaction with the outside world. I have suffered from anxiety and shyness pretty much all my life but lately it seems to have worsened and now I have also fell down the depression hole. I want to expand further on this and rant more as I don't have any real friends to talk to but I will keep that for another post. 

Now, Coming to the main topic, I have been wanting to go on a trip and just escape my sad life and my room for a little while to get some fresh air and a little motivation. I would have preferred to go with some friends as I am very unexperienced but I don't have any. I have only got two of my college acquaintances with whom I keep in touch occasionally.  

So, I wanted your guys help to figure out what would be the ideal location for me to travel to. I currently live in Chandigarh, so any good, safe, enjoyable place in the north would be preferable. I want to go for not more than 3-4 days given this would be my first trip and I can't take much time off college too. I have money to spend but I would like to be as frugal as possible.  It would also greatly help if with any place you suggest, u can also mention all the important details like best way to travel there, safe places to stay at, activities to do there on my own, important things to keep in mind as I will be quite tensed going on my own and would like to have majority of the things figured out in advance. 

I have wasted my entire college life, So this is kinda my desperate attempt to have a memorable experience before I graduate too. I hope you guys can help me out.",37,AskIndia,0c1b1aea-3166-11e5-aaec-0ef63926eacd,26

307,Fuzzy Logic,"Scrutiny of an encounter that got me thinking.

TLDR: How to be patient/ diplomatic with people who have views/ converse in ways very different from your own?
  
I’m 26/F, grew up middle/ upper middle class Indian, holistically educated. I was raised in a somewhat traditional household but work and study have allowed me the privilege of a fair amount of travel and living abroad. Rather presumptuously, I’m going to say I’m a fairly easy going person. I recently moved from Europe to America, taking a break from work to study for a year.

Here’s an account of day 17 of my university in east coast: I meet some fellow students after class, and bumped into one Indian (Ms.AD) who lived in the same hood as me. We walk back home together. AD has just met 3 Indian girls, who speak the same language and are from the same town as her, and promptly proceeded to dig into their personal history. During the 25 minute walk back, she decides to give me the brief. I had met them previously, and in my interaction so far, found them to be very friendly and polite people. AD tells me, hey did you know those 3 are married to men who are 8-10 years older than them? I say no but it’s really their personal choice. She says with her nose up in the air and absolute conviction, I know this type, their tuition is taken care of, they don’t have to worry about their visas once the degree is done. She launches into a speech about how women aren’t independent enough, marriages are not meaningful, and how, by participating in this passive form of patriarchy which gives them a benefit of more freedom and money, they bring down the collective IQ and reputation of other fellow Indian women. She then proceeds to discreetly asks me whether my last name reflects my caste. I say no, and knowing that I’m South Indian, asks me what it means to belong to XYZ community in Karnataka. I’m dumbfounded and honestly don’t know how to answer this question. While I struggle to collect my thoughts, she laughs at her own jokes and observations, which I now find more off color by the minute thanks to the sudden blasphemy I was subjected to.

What does that even mean? I wonder what she was trying to gauge, their worth or repute? Here is a generally wealthy, educated woman who just told me that it’s 21st century and time for us to stand up for ourselves, also trying to make some sort of judgement based on communal divides that shouldn’t matter. 

I get home in a bad temper and slam the door, not wanting this company on my way back home anymore. I probably uttered 10 words in the last 30 minutes, and felt so exhausted and puzzled. Was it me who was being haughty and judgmental? Had my patience grown so thin that I am irked by anything that doesn’t seem agreeable to me? I got to class the next day to find Ms.AD sitting at a table with the same 3 girls she had talked about, rapidly babbling away in their common native tongue and steered straight to the other side.
I’ve had a few interactions with her since then and struggle let it not sap my energy. Penny for your thoughts?",6,Rant / Vent,dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418,4

I got a 100% scholarship and am a topper (well  more or less). Also parental pressure is no problem, there never force  me to do anything and will be fine with whatever I choose. They didn't  force me to choose medical either I just enjoy biology (fav subject), so  there is no way I'm taking non-medical. Also I don't want to take maths  either, I'm good at it but I find it extremely boring.

I  started with elimination and there is no way I'm taking maths or music.  So I have to choose between painting, physical education and CS.

PE sounds really boring so I don't know.

I'm  actually good at painting but it has no use later on ( I like it as a  hobby but studying it for two years isn't going to benefit me in  anyway), I will probably forget most of the things within a week.

As  for CS, I checked the syllabus and it's mostly python for 11th and  python and SOL for 12th and have already done most of the 11th syllabus  in python ( I was bored in summer break had nothing else to do so  started learning python and completed the basics in 2 weeks from Udemy)  And now I realized I have basically covered most of my 11th syllabus  already. And learning programming in a digital age is going to  definitely help me, so it's also useful.

But  learning CS might take a lot of time and I have to focus on NEET, and  neither am I planning to take engineering later on (but still it's more  useful than painting or PE). But I do find it interesting (but not more  than bio and chem)

344,Women can be catfishes too. Stay safe online.,"I had a bad experience just recently. Like over a week ago, I saw a fun post, gave it an award, she sent the ‘Thanks for the award’ template dm. I said something, she replied and got to talking. 

We have been talking since. Exchanged pics on the second day. She gave me her telegram id on the fourth day along with her insta and twitter. We started sending voice clips after that. She gave me her number on the fifth day. 
Everything seemed great. But the problem was she was way too flirty since the first day. Towards the sixth and seventh day started telling me that she wants to be with me forever. On the eighth day she said the three magic words. 

I know what you guys must be thinking. This is too good to be true. I know. Which is why I was cautious. I played along with all of it but I was cautious. I don’t know how much of what she said is a lie. But she mixed in a lot of truth to it for sure. 

We talked on audio calls for more than 3 hours in total up until this point. We had talked about doing video calls soon. And even about meeting each other soon. 

Today, unprovoked, she sent me a baby picture of herself. That’s the mistake she did. I knew it wasn’t her picture. I asked her to come clean, she insisted it’s her and even made a fake chat convo screenshot with her ‘mom’ where her mom sends her this photo to prove to me. 

Well I’ve decided not to text her again. 

I’m glad she messed up so soon after we started talking. What if she hadn’t and played me for longer? Since she was a girl, and could actually have had video calls in the future, she genuinely could have played me for longer. 

She actually seems to have an entire alt persona. Including social media accounts, phone number etc. 

I don’t know why she lied. I’m sure she was just lonely but also didn’t want an online friendship to become anything serious. Which is totally understandable. But lying and manipulating others for that, that’s not cool.

Anyone can be a catfish. Just make sure you don’t fall for it. They might have sophisticated techniques to try and get away with it. But always be on the lookout. 

Stay safe and healthy you guys. 🤗🤗",21,Non Political,8f105a84-7ea0-11e3-bba1-12313b0c91be,31

Attempting for a new beginning

Well, Guy's now that I'm(25M) earning via freelancing. I like to travel across India and visit new places.

Furthermore, I'm looking to connect with new people.
A bit about myself, I'm being deaf by birth so I rarely go to school, till class 12th I got no friends. In college, I was a ghost! Somehow, I've gained some skills.

With freelance money, I bought myself hearing aids. Now, I can hear but there's no one to talk to. My personality falls under INFJ. I'm done hibernating for 25 years. So I like to move out (exploration). But I have no idea where to go? I know about covid so patiently waiting for the removal of restrictions.

In the meantime. I looking for Feedback on how to start my new beginning as a solo traveller. Where to go first? How to select the next place.

Recommendations for books, destinations, cautions, tips, budget management, direction all are welcome🙏🏻

I'll be happy to connect to someone who has some experience in travelling.  I'm also working on my speech. 

I know by heart majority of Indians are kind and good people. Every state has its own way of saying we're proud to be Indian.

Forgive my english / grammar 🙏🏻

Looking for to hearing from you all.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/svd7lv/my\_fianc%C3%A9\_told\_me\_the\_truth\_and\_it\_broke\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/svd7lv/my_fianc%C3%A9_told_me_the_truth_and_it_broke_me/)

I talked to my parents regarding this. I explained to them about her intentions and straight away said no to this AM. Luckily, and to my surprise, they were supportive and even thanked me for telling them this. They were in utter shock, and I did not even tell them about her sexual past. 

Later that afternoon, I called her and told her that what she said on our date had disappointed me and   I am backing out of this marriage. I asked her why she lied about her past and if she is hiding more. I even confronted her about the reason she is marrying me. She was in utter silence and soon started to cry. She told me that she did like me and she will do anything for me (Not falling for this).

Later that evening, my father calls her father and says that I am not ready for this marriage and we are backing out. Her father as expected demanded to talk to me. All in all, I told him my reason and he was really pissed. He even asks me if I am ""gay"". His father hurled some abuses to my family and demanded damage support or something. He is gonna file FIR against my family for extorsion and stuff. Although I don't think he is really gonna go that far. 

So this is it, I know it's a very vague post about what has happened. Trust me, I am saving you the trouble of details. Also, if you are wondering, no one knows about the girl's sexual past except me. I wished to tell her father this, but I controlled myself. 

This was the worst week of my life and I am thinking to take a vacation. Maybe a solo trip to keep my mind off this fuckery. Thank you all you guys who gave me such valuable advice. I hope no one goes through these bs.",12,Rant / Vent,dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418,8

The Nike official store (Nike.com) has the item in INR and it is the same amount as the stores here. But the items apparently get shipped from the US, or at least from outside the country. 

I contacted their support to enquire about customs and import duties and their rep was well informed and ensured you only pay the amount on the checkout page. The shipping charges come to INR 750 and that's it. 

I asked her what happens if the delivery partner asks for customs charges during delivery and she said that I can raise a ticket and get it resolved. And then she pointed to [this page ](https://www.nike.com/in/help/a/sales-tax-gs) on the site which says:-

DOES MY NIKE ORDER TOTAL INCLUDE DUTIES AND TAXES?

""Yes, any applicable duties or taxes are included in your order total during checkout. We calculate duties and taxes according to the laws governing the delivery address. And please note, we don't accept tax-exempt orders.""

So I should be good right? 

Well let's see. I already placed the order and the delivery date is nearly a month away. If anything i will come to know what happens.

So, this guy assumes I am a kid and he sends me a message on Paytm that says ""payment received from indian army of rs 1"" and asks me to click on pay button underneath and enter the amount that will mean accepting his payment.

So basically when I started writing for JEE, I knew it was way above my capabilities but somehow I managed to get admission in an Engineering college in the town. So basically since the start, it's not working It is just par my level of academics, I've been trying hard but still not being able to co op with rest of the class, and became like an outlaw, as if I sit next to someone they go somewhere else, being alone, I've stopped going there. Used to come early too, my mind just don't even want to work anymore I'm just always tired of it. As I got exhausted day by day I don't know what to do anymore so I tell this to my parents, that I can't do all this anymore it is above my capacity and they say it is because I don't attend classes and those who do, have no problem, it a fault with me. So this option have been cancelled, and I don't know now where to ask for help, I know they are not completely wrong but my brain is just exhausted of all this, and I don't see any way out.

TLDR : I am unable to co op with rest of the students and am being outlawed and exhausted, When I ask help from parents that I can't do this anymore they rose their hands and cannot help, need advice on what to do.",30,AskIndia,0c1b1aea-3166-11e5-aaec-0ef63926eacd,5

442,To my young buds and parents,"If there is one advice I wish I heard when I was a child would be to be really careful using porn, the dark process of its escalation and how it messes up your mind, consciousness, integrity, love and your entire life.

The one thing I wish I could’ve done is to quit it when I could, when I was young, before its dark hands gripped my brain strong, manipulated my thoughts for my entire life.

PORN IS A REALLY NASTY HIGHLY ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE. It sucks you out of your innocence, **it sucks you out of your love** and messes up your whole life just like any substance addiction does.

You might already know the fact that porn was a key player the exponential expansion of internet throughout the world. Porn was a big part of the web, it is, and will continue to do so as long as there will be internet.

The govt blocks it in one way, people can access by another. Its immutable.

In our country, internet is at its peak expansion today and will continue over the years. With the advent of online leaning, parents and government by giving children mobiles, tablets and laptops- the keys to this amazing and yet dark world of internet, we must advise these young curious minds on how to walk though the chaos and how to use internet judiciously for one’s growth

Children are always curious and they learn fast. You don’t have to teach a kid on how to use the web because he’ll definitely will figure out on his own. Parents cannot monitor what their child is looking at all the time. And just as they are curious, they are smart. They learn their parents and can deceive them very well to play their favourite games or watch some youtube/social media when they should be learning for school.

The internet today is anything but clean. Every website, ad, social media, youtube videos are projecting quasi-sexual contents to get peoples attention.

Also for males, the most sexual parts of the body is not what’s between his legs and rather his eyes and brain. Human males gets more sexually excited by seeing than any other sense.

All these factors- the accessibility of the internet, their age, sexualized contents, biology of brain, dopamine surge, novelty of porn and many more easily pave way for PORN ADDICTION.

The chances of a kid stumbling upon some porn is, simply put, extremely high. The chances of him getting hooked on it is also extremely high. Oh- and in children, the frontal part of the brain which is responsible for judgements and decision making is still in developing stage. It completes its development way later, during early adulthood. At the same time, the part of the brain that is responsible for motivation and dopamine release is fully functional. So part of the brain that says ‘do it’ is really active while the part that says ‘think about it’ is weak.  So ‘do it’ wins all the time and sadly they cant help it. That leads to compulsive sexual behavior which causes a series of bad situations whole life.

If you are a young boy reading this, just know that porn is just as bad and dangerous than any other addiction. You will hear a lot of opinions saying its safe, but don’t fall for those. All your free time will be used up by porn. You wont even have a hobby. You will choose porn when you’re sad, you will choose porn when you are stressed, you will use it first thing in the morning and last thing in bed. You wont know how to talk to girls and all the time you should be with friends and girls, exploring sexuality and intimacy in a healthy natural way, you will be in your dark room fapping to fucked up videos. Your view on women will be changed in a bad way. Including your loved ones. I could go on how it can fuck you up. And boy, it does, pretty bad.

Do whatever ways you can think of, use all your strength and stop watching porn. The sooner you quit, the easier it will be.

And to the parents reading this, please EDUCATE your children about porn. Just as about the dark sides of social media and gaming. Don’t tell them “Don’t watch porn” cos watching porn will be the next thing they will want to do. Instead, tell them how our body work sexually, what is healthy sexuality, what porn is, how fucked up the contents are, how a young mind can get hooked on, and how porn will effect the rest of his life. This works wayyy better than just putting parental controls/monitors, or yelling or beating him up if he is caught watching porn.

Also don't give them lots of privacy with phones/laptops in their hands. Check on them time to time, make sure that they are seeing it. 

In future, with unrestricted use of internet, a huge portion of our youth will become porn addicts. Lots of them cant get their thing up, all of them will have weird concept of sexuality, having low social life and proportionately lots of them will act out on their desires in real life and rape cases will skyrocket and crimes against children will be very high. Lots of broken marriages, lots of damaged brains, depression and deaths.

The internet can't do anything about it, the government can't do anything about it. Only the children and concerned parents could act against it and do something to decrease the number of people that end up in the above mentioned group, in future.

So i ordered a gold ring for my gf for her birthday who lives in another town and the seller shipped the wrong one so i talked to the seller he agreed to replace it as it was mistake from their side and  told me send it back . Now notice the seller has small business they cant arrange pickup like flipkart . The Ring is of Rajasthan's pratapgarh  Local art called ""Thewa"" which a gold painting on glass and only 1 family knows how to do it in the entire India. They also have GI tag for it . You have to  manually ask them to get it made on whatsapp.

I talked to my gf wheather she wanna keeps this one or want the one we ordered she said she want the one that we ordered so i arranged this Delhivery pickup from home service . I told her to pack  the ring with proper address on the package and proper packaging. 

I went to delhivery site and login with my gf's number ,I put sender's and reciever's address and what is being shipped with value of it .
So i paid 190rs around in total in which 89rs is shipment charge and rest money is for the insurance of the product . So the Ring cost me about 4500 after includung gst and delivery charges and the value of it 4000 which was on recipt that i had put on Delhivery website ,now they show i get a refund of 3200 if the package gets lost in transit. I thought it would be okay since it is from delhi to jaipur and would take 2-3 days  

The next day on 12th of Feb They send a guy  to pickup the package and we get the tracking number and   all details on the website.
On 14th i was tracking the order and it was showing that it has reached to jaipur and will be delivered on 15th . I sent a text to the seller that the package will be delivered to you soon be ready with replacement.

Now here what happens after, the tracking page keep showin package is in jaipur and the date of delivery gets pushed from 15th to 16 th to 17th. So i logged in to the account and went to 'My orders' and raised a query about why it is taking so long . They sent an email saying that it is on high priority.

Next day i raised another query and another 1 with reciever's  alternative contact  number just in case are not able to reach the person .
After evening i login to the account and goes to check the order in 'My order' page now what i find that is no order there the page is just blank so i go to their twitter handle  and tweet and i get a reply .He asks me about tracking details awb number and all and i gave him those . He said that he raised the issue to their team and they are looking into it .

Now it is 19th i am getting worried because there is no response from them anywhere  not even on twitter or anywhere i get irritated and go their twitter i see their handle is filled with such complaints where the shipment is stuck for days  even one guy complaint about the delay in the shipment of cancer medicines.

Delhivery does not have any support via the calls (not in my knowledge ,i haven't found one  yet ) in the name of support they have the email which takes 24-48 hours to reply ""it is on high priority"" and the twitter handle which does the same . 

At this point i have given all the hopes on getting the package and guess i was right , today i check the tracking page and it say ""Lost"" and my gf also gets the sms of the package got lost in the transit and we can claim the refund in email. No email yet from their side , looks like  we have to send one ourslef .

So  we Paid 4700 for it right from the start to return it back and now the item got lost we get 3200 from refund (onlyif  we get it ,dont know when and how ) which is fine to me .
The emotional toll it took on me personally that I  have planning this gift for her since the last year sept and it has goes horrible 10 days of frustation . I wish i had preferred Blue Dart or any other service over this .


So the conclusion is don't ever use Delhivery for any kind of shipment, you are on god's mercy if something unexpected happens with your package because certainly Delhivery support is not with you .",53,Rant / Vent,dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418,10

471,NPCI adds 'UPI Number' to the UPI Framework,"**The Why?**

Users had unique email ID like **UPI IDs (example@upi)** which could be used across apps to allow interoperability b/w different app users in sending & receiving. This functionality could easily be used in smartphones but not elsewhere like feature phones using UPI through USSD based [\*99#](https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/99/product-overview).

**The What?**

**UPI Number** is not the mobile number (although it also can be). Previously, to send money to other app users, only the UPI ID (example@upi) or QR could be used. Entering a PhonePe User's mobile number in Google Pay did not let the user be found because money could be sent only to the same app user.

UPI Number (Random 8-9 digits) are now an alternative to the UPI ID for ease of use in feature phones using \*99#. Now, you can create a new 8-9 digit number OR use your mobile number **&** link it with your UPI ID. Now this freshly created **UPI number** can be used as an alternative method to the UPI ID making it easy for everyone, different app users & feature-phone users.

&#x200B;

* If you create a new 8-9 digit UPI num.: This UPI number can be shared with anyone & be used in any app to receive money just like using the UPI ID, which allowed interoperability.
* If you use your mobile num as the UPI num.: This mobile number can be shared with anyone & be used in any app to receive money. Previously someone could only send you money using mobile number if you used the same app, but now since it's your UPI number, it can be used in any app to receive payments.

&#x200B;

Now you only need to use one app, have one UPI ID & share one UPI Number to send & ask for one UPI number to receive money from anyone. ^(Especially those who use mobile numbers to send & receive)

477,Should I stay in America?,"At the young age of 18, I came to the US for college and it was so difficult for me to transition to life here as an international student. Before coming here, I looked down on India and all I saw were the negatives. But after moving to the US, I began to appreciate Indian values of community and communal living but I still liked the US better. Fast forward to COVID and I went back to India for a year (took a gap year from my American college) as a semi-adult (still living with my parents but working in India) and I absolutely loved it. I worked in a startup in Bengaluru and everyone was so warm, welcoming, and I felt a genuine sense of community. 

Post-COVID, I'm back in the US to finish my college degree but I don't enjoy life here as much anymore. All I see are superficial conversations and superficial social connections. It feels like people are not interested in me and I don't feel a sense of community. Even as a college student, it feels like professional growth here is prioritized above everything else, especially social connection. I'm graduation soon and do have a job lined up for me in the US (I will be working on the STEM OPT) which I feel like I should take to make my American college education, specifically the money that was spent on my college tuition, worth it. But I don't feel happy or at home here. I feel like I could move back to India in a few years but I'm worried about the opportunity cost of these few years and what I'm missing out on (a sense of comfort, community, and belonging). I'm worried that if I wait too long, I won't have a community in India either. I recognize that I'm in a very privileged position - both in the US and in India.

482,"My friend is being harassed over phone calls. Need to find those people, need help.","Hi,

So my friend is being harassed by a couple of guys, they call her from multiple numbers.

We think that they are some guys from her school because the guys who talked to her told her that they are from her school. (We do not know if that is true)

This has been going on for 2 weeks now.

We have all the numbers saved, I asked her to record the calls whenever that happens, unfortunately, her phone gives a voice notification that the call is being recorded so that was useless.

So my doubt was how can I find the identities of the people who are doing this? At least the identities of the numbers that she's getting the calls from. Tried Truecaller but not helpful.

I am thinking of filing a complaint with the police but I highly doubt they will give any information of the numbers, or that they would even help us as they see worse cases of harassment every day.

498,How to teach a rascal technician a lesson?,"
Few months back, I went to Nehru Place, Delhi, I had a spare old smartphone that was not switching on, so I thought to get it repaired so that it could be used as a backup.

I went to this guy who took Rs.1700 to replace the battery and fix the motherboard. On returning, I somehow missed my SIM tray at his place and even he didn't offer to insert the SIM tray after fixing the device. After 1-2 days, I went to his shop to collect my SIM tray, upon checking, I found out that the SIM was not detected, so I told this to him. After multiple arguments, I could make him confess that it was he who damaged my smartphone's SIM tray because I was 100% certain that there was no issue in the SIM tray, it was only the issue that device was not powering on.

After confessing that he damaged the SIM tray, he assured that he will fix it if he finds a spare SIM tray in the market, he called his contacts to know about the availability and since the device is quite old, he didn't find any old SIM tray, he asked me that he will try to arrange it from Gaffar Market, Delhi, to which I agreed and returned to home. Thereafter, I contacted him 2-3 times to know whether he could arrange it or not, to which he denied. 

I kind of lost hope and got busy with my work, it had been 2 months since I last contacted him, yesterday I realised that I had kinda lost my Rs. 1700 to this person, got my smartphone damaged to the level it can't be repaired and contacted him whether he found the part or not. He contacted me after 5-10 minutes to say a no. I asked him to give me a solution as it was he who damaged my smartphone, he said that he has no solution and disconnected the phone. I contacted him again to tell that the least he can do to fix this issue is to refund the amount that he took to repair my smartphone as I cannot use the smartphone and this is where he took the u-turn and said that he didn't do any damage, he fixed the issue for what I submitted my device, it kinda anguished me about how can this rascal say like that when it is he only who screwed my device! I have had multiple heated arguments with this piece of shit and informed him that I have all the previous call recordings and even the audio recording of the chat I had at his place in Nehru Place and threatened to file a complaint in consumer court to which he didn't seem to be giving any shit. Later on, he disconnected my call saying he can't talk on the phone and asked to come to his place; and stopped picking my calls.

Now I have a few options in hand
1. Ignore the case as the device was an old 2015 model, though 20K INR at that time and bear the amount that he took for the repair and use the phone for other stuff but calls, take it as a lesson and let the Karma do its thing but it kinda looks insulting to me!
2. Go at this shit's place with proper video recording on, create ruckus and record everything, teach him some lesson, ask him how dare he deny for the damage he did, ask to compensate for the damage he did so that he will think twice before practising such things again.
3. Bad review to his business but it is not listed on Google map!
4. (At fun point) Somehow distribute his number to credit card agents who call him 5-10 times per day to disturb him to not let him do his work properly and will cost him a piece.

Option 1 seems more intelligent to pursue as I don't think it would be wise to channel my energy to create rukus as this would affect me mentally and will waste my time, I was kinda ignorant about the fact that my he damaged my device but the thing that offended me is how can this piece of shit deny that he didn't damage my device and what if the amount was considerably higher! This shit should be taught a lesson!

As proof, I have his shop's visiting card with details of the services he did, audio recording of the chat I had at his place, call recordings. 

I really thank you for reading this till here, I would really appreciate it if you could share your thoughts in this.

Thanks a lot.",0,Law & Courts,687b3904-6082-11eb-af80-0e41d1ca0be9,0

I didn't have a very financially liberal childhood/college days. All I knew was to grind and get a good job which I did, but in the course of doing so, lost all the opportunities to make college memories (which I regret everyday). Even in job, I am just grinding everyday for past few years, not enjoying anything. Why? Because I have this fear embedded in me that I will become poor if i don't grind.

Anyways not going to bore you with my sad story. Coming to the topic, I have finally decided to take some time off from work i.e. from 2nd March - 11th March and I want to plan a 4-5 days solo trip. I am ready to go on one of those paid group trips(the one which has mostly unknown people). I want to enjoy some time, living freely away from all the tensions of career or money.

My preferences are: No trekking, no cold places. Budget - 10k(slightly variable)
Can you please help with follow queries:
1. What places would be a great travel experience?
2. Which trusted online website/ trip advisors should I use to book such group trips?
3. Any piece of advice for me who's a first time solo traveller, like how much money to carry, precautions to take, documents etc.

But I think everyone is not very happy with the quality of life and work outside employment out.

Hence you decide moving outside India and I wish to have you face the dilemma on how you fix it -

&#x200B;

1. UK, Netherlands, Germany - Entry for 3+ years people working in the product has easier over a period of time. Though the salaries are not great, there is an opportunity to work with good startups. AND PR/Citizenship takes a long time
2. Canada - PR takes time.  Though if you get there to live, the entire North America SaaS startup scene opens up.

My conservative parents have always been overprotective but let me choose my own profession. My dad stays away from us for the past 20 years due to work so its just been me, mom and my little bro. Safe to say shes attached to me more than my bro. But after a toxic relationship blew up on my face a few years ago, she started calling me names that I make dumb choices and and can't look out for myself. But there were still times of normalcy where she used ro shower her love. The overprotective and controlling nature never subsided though. I still have to ask permission for trips or meeting friends or ordering food etc. So I decided to shift Bangalore, partly ro learn to be independent and make my own choices, and partly to seek therapy and heal from my past trauma. I am now in a healthy relationship but my parents refuse to accept this, which is fair. But they aren't letting me go Bangalore either. My mom's blaming me that I ruined her life because she chose raising me as a fulltime mother over taking up a job. She's saying I'm selfish who's just looking out for my own benefits.

So in the time of need why India is responsible ? **Why should we help them just for being Indian, even though they themselves didn't choose India.**

570,Is it weird or creepy for a 19 year old (M) and 17 year old (F) to be in a relationship in India?,"I am friends with a 17 year old girl (for a little less than a year now), we have met online(are physically almost 400 km away from each other) on Instagram(on a teenage social/political group), over the months we had a lot of discussion about various things, over DM, and now even on phone calls for some months, our views on most issues are pretty similar, and we have became really close friends, over the course we have also developed feelings for each other. The problem is she is still 17(will be 18 in 5 months), whereas I am already 19(will be 20 in 9 months), she is still in high school(class 12) until 2023, whereas I have already passed high school last year in August. 
Both of us are preparing for NEET(I am a dropper), that is I am not in a college as of now(will be probably in one in next few months), and so are in a ""similar"" life stages, as of now. Although we both don't feel any sort of gap while talking in our maturity, understanding, feelings, or pop culture references, but does it seem creepy or weird for someone from outside? 
We both are really keen on pursuing this relationship for long term, how should we proceed? 
Should we wait for a year until she completes high school, or until she is 18, or shall we do something else?

NOTE : Please don't preach about the risks involved in online relationships, we both are already aware about it, besides it is an entirely different topic, talking about which will only derail the conversation from the actual query.",22,AskIndia,0c1b1aea-3166-11e5-aaec-0ef63926eacd,19

All the typical shit like girls should not be out after 6 PM, no male friends, he even denies her for going to her best friend's house which he had known for 10 years.

He pretty much knows every time where we are and where we are going but sometimes we do go places without telling him when he is at work, sometimes we tell friend's house and instead go to a cafe or something.

Now he is asking us to provide our GPS access in some GPS Tracker app he downloaded so he can double-check on us.

We denied and admitted that we do go other places, we assured him that we haven't done and won't do anything wrong. We told him we are adults and we can keep some secrets and make our decisions. 

Then he got angry as fuck, lashed out at my mom. This was 2 days ago, now he stays grumpy as fuck, would not talk to us, and just talk to my mom about how we are going to kick them out of the house in a few years.

586,Man these 'pan card details de do job ke liye scams' suck the big one,"I know I've just joined this page today but I've been using reddit since a friend convinced me to give it a try. I have posted previously (in general that is) and just wanted to get this scam out in the market. Even if some of you may know about this but a larger audience could benefit nonetheless. So I was approached twice by different job consulting agencies. Their websites were legitimate but their glassdoor reviews were shady somehow. I was from the beginning asked about my pan card details and told that this is needed to apply at TCS. Now I don't care which company reaches out, as long as it's not my CV, I'm not willing to share any personal information unless it comes after a job offer in hand, so the consultants demand for pan number sets my alarm bells ringing. I had a discussion at home since my uncle was in HR for more than a decade and he said that as a policy they don't ask for personal info at the onset. Only CV and a background check is done. I ended up rejecting the first consultant. 

When another one reached out to me a few days ago, I got suspicious as to why is TCS mandating people to gather info. I had read up online that there could be scams but there were mixed results. This time I did some digging around and came across a tata group page with a disclaimer that they do not ask for money or info. But to confirm my suspicion, I reached out to the concerned hiring manager at TCS whose name was mentioned in the job description as someone that would apparently be the person I'd report to (side note - the name slip up could have been a big mistake on the apparent consultant's part). Long story short, I reached out to the gentlemen on LinkedIn asking if this is legitimate and he said that this is a scam and told me to not share my pan card details with anybody. I ended up sharing the consultants name with him in case they'd like to take some action against the company. 

Moral of the story: even if you're really desperate for a job don't share any, I repeat, any damn personal info to anyone. 

P. S. I do have a job, rather I freelance with one of the big4 so I'm not in a desperate of a job but there could be people who could be preyed upon hence this was necessary to share.",29,Rant / Vent,dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418,6

China and countries around it:
So we saw how China is taking over Hongkong. They have similar plans for Taiwan. They recently issued a statement saying Taiwan has always been part of China. But they also have their own government and own country. China wants to invade surrounding geographic area.

I just googled Kashmir (outside India) and unsurprisingly it does not have any map lines as we have for other states of India. Basically whole region is controlled by 3 countries, India, Pakistan and China. We know China has been trying to invade few parts of Arunachal Pradesh. 

Now the real question is:
Should The western countries get involved in other issues? As an example of Ukraine, USA or UK does not have direct borders with them.
Same goes for Taiwan, if it happens who should get involved? 
For Kashmir, should anyone else get involved apart from China, Pakistan and India?

I'm 16 and like to dress more androgynous in comfortable clothes like T-shirts, jeans and joggers but for some reason she keeps on giving me skirts and weird fancy pinky tops which I am usually sure I will never wear. Also some of her clothes are form fitting and I'm insecure about my breasts and like things that are a little baggy.

And that it not it, she somehow finds stuff she used to wear when SHE was a kid and wants me to dress like they did in 80s.

This is just not my style, I don't like any jewellery or makeup or skirts and she starts complaining like something is wrong with me.

I finally gathered the courage to tell her I don't like those kind of clothes and she said that I'm too young too decide that and I will eventually start liking them after I wear them for some time. She also said that all girls my age like wearing those clothes (they don't) and I will thank her later. She said I'm just being immature.

Whenever I bring this topic with my grandma I'm dealt with like an ungrateful freak. I just don't want to waste her money on things I would probably never buy (One time she bought me a dress which probably costed around 3000 rupees and I never wore it)

I thought i had a common cold so initially i just took leaves till i fell better.

619,A weird conversation with an old man probably led me to lose focus on my riding and I fell while parking,"I'm going through some personal problems and little bit depression.

So I often go for practice motorcycle riding on little to no traffic roads and dirt streets and spending time in uncrowded places like near a small canal or fields.

And it does help. **I'm learning riding at a late age** and I have a good time when I sit alone.

**Here's a weird (at least I felt uncomfortable with him) conversation happened:**

A 60+ year old aged man stopped and told me you look mentally upset because I'm noticing you for 4 days and you daily come here and sit alone.

I said yes I might look different from others at the moment because I've lost my job and I come here to learn riding and spending some time as it helps me feel better. Further it's the best time for me to learn riding as I might not get a chance again.

I lost one of my family member some years ago that has also some impact on my personal life. I didn't tell him because then he would go into details. But that's not why I go there so I didn't tell him. **He was just curious rather than having a genuine conversation.**

Then he started politics. Discussed some privatization of businesses. Then he asked where do I live, what does my parents do, what is your father's name. Are you married or not (I'm not married so far).

The he said you're jobless but it's fortunate **your father has a govt. job so you don't need to worry.** I felt embarrassed and I didn't know how to reply.

**Lastly, he said what's your caste?** Again I told him caste but I felt very embarrassed.

I kept telling him all what he asked but he was reluctant telling about himself. **He was just curious.**

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After that he left. **And I decided to go home ASAP** **because I had lost my focus.**

I stopped in the way just to adjust a few things like helmet. I forgot to pull the side stand down to park and I lost balance and I fell down in dirt. It happened first time.

It was good that there was no injury or damage. It is a small road with no other vehicles.

It may sound like an obvious mistake - and obviously it was my silly mistake but I still feel it all happened because I had lost some attention and focus. I was thinking about the conversation all the time before it happened.

But I feel if I hadn't done that conversation with that man, I wouldn't decide to return home and would pay more attention while parking the bike like I always do.",79,Rant / Vent,dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418,25

630,Scared of losing my job,"I got a job recently and I am scared of losing it. It took me quite a long time to get it which makes me more scared of losing it


I am mainly scared because of my shyness/social anxiety. Sometimes I have to call strangers and I avoid making them and so I am not as efficient as I could be. I procrastinate on reporting to my senior because of the same shyness. 

I also feel very sleepy throughout the day and don't feel like I am working at my full efficiency. This further makes me think that I could lose my job

Also, I don't really enjoy the job as much. And my family doesn't depend on me having the job which makes me think that I could do something better, probably be self employed or businessperson. But again my fear of judgements of other people stop me. 

Anyway, the primary concern at this point is losing my job. It's a good job, not a highly paid, but maybe I would learn quite a bit here. And the work culture is good too. But I feel disinterested and scared which could end up in me losing the job.

My college does have an anti-ragging cell. And I know the contact of the teacher in charge of that, what should I do ?

These rules btw, come in light of recent events : A guy from (1st year) some other department got drunk in front of the seniors and was like about to jump from the terrace. so now they are doing such stupid things to all the students of 1st year ?

Their f\*cking dress code includes : no open neck t-shirts. I am a male and this is for boys. Like wtf do they have with open neck t shirts ? almost all my clothes are open neck. Also who the fuck are these assholes to decided what I wear or not wear ?

Also they want us to remember the names of all the senior CRs for some reason ? like why ? this is top level narcissism and the kids must be really f\*cked up in their head.

Does this qualify as ragging ? FUCK THESE ASSHOLES

671,Chapter 1 - The beginning - Please share honest feedback,"If I try to recall when it all started I get a glimpse of us playing football on the university grounds. I had suddenly realized that I wanted to go out to Delhi to prepare for the prestigious IIT JEE exam. But if anybody would have asked me why do I want to prepare for IIT JEE, my answer would have been that ""my brother told me that the smartest people go to IIT"". Now was this a good answer or not? I didn't know nor did I care. But one thing was clear I wanted to leave my town and nothing could stop me.

I recall in my childhood my mother wished that I would become a doctor or join the army. But I told her that I can't remember so many facts hence the doctor was out of the picture and the army was too boring for me. She felt sad on hearing, maybe even cried a little, but she didn't have any option. It's not like she could abandon me. Mothers weren't heard much in our societies during that time. I hope things have improved now.

Anyway, back to the fateful day of playing football, I told all my friends that I would be leaving school after 10th standard. Few of them were surprised, few continued playing and few enquired more about the plan. ""So you will study in school and go for coaching also? I have heard students don't go to school and only attend coaching classes. Is this true?"" asked one of my friends. ""Yes I have heard also, 11th & 12th marks anyway don't matter, its the JEE exam that's most important"". Suddenly a good friend of mine, out of the blue said: ""I will also go"". ""Wait..what?"" I asked astonishingly. He just replied ""Yes"" and ran back to the playground to play football like it was the last few times he would be allowed to kick a football.

So we, three friends, went for the entrance exam for the coaching institute around April. Delhi during that month was hot and dry as a desert. It was like a burning furnace and it seemed impossible to stay at such a place for a long time. The heat penetrated your skin and you would gasp with thirst. We stayed at my uncle's apartment who was working there as an engineer. The next day, somehow we three aspirants gave our entrance exam and returned to our town.

In May our results came out and we all got selected by the coaching institute. Though this was nothing but a marketing gimmick at that point, we were ignorant enough to understand this so we celebrated. Like the first step of the journey has been completed. But this also meant that we have to move Delhi from our town. This had slipped our minds in the excitement of preparing for the exam. And it hit us like a thunderstorm.

We were only 15 -16 years old at that time and leaving home at that point seemed a scary task for us and scarier for our parents. My mother one day refused to send me away and said that I can continue studying in my hometown only and take coaching in the distance mode. I was also having doubts about going, leaving everything behind but then I thought it won't be possible without me leaving the home. One has to go out to the sea to experience the water, the sea doesn't come to you. This is how things work. This case wasn't any different.

So we packed our bags to move towards the destination. I'm sure the other two friends would have felt the same anxiety as me but I didn't discuss this with them. We all were going on our journeys albeit together. Everyone had dreams in their eyes. But who's dream was it, ours? our parents'? our society's?",2,Non Political,8f105a84-7ea0-11e3-bba1-12313b0c91be,1

I have been working in a public sector bank(national Bank of India) since last 1.5 years as a Clerk. I've been posted in a branch which is appropriately 75 kms from home (about 2.5 hours journey one way). The problem is, my father has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease since 2019 and is mostly bedridden since then. He can't eat, go to toilet alone, doesn't understand most of things we say, heck he doesn't even remember family members. He needs a caretaker to be constantly around 24/7. I started working since November 2020 and I thought about asking about job posting in my hometown. But was apprehensive about how they will take and I thought I will talk about it after six months of probationary period. Meanwhile, for whole of 2021, my sister and brother in law moved to my hometown due to Work from Home and also to look after my Dad ( we had a caretaker too) so that my mother doesn't feel alone. My sister and brother in law moved back to Bangalore now that WFH has ended for some companies and this taken a toll on me about how to manage things alone. Caretakers are changing frequently. I'm so worried and constantly stressed due to this. How do I convince my HR about my family situation considering that I kept mum all this while.

693,National Politics from a Tamilian's View,"Hello everyone!

I hail from the state of Tamil Nadu, I am quite a long-time lurker in this sub and various other subs of India. I have a keen interest in trying to understand our national Politics and Government structure.

I have seen some comments on Tamil Nadu such as we are Dravidian Nationalists or Tamil Supremacy guys or Periyar Followers. Some comments may be just jokes but some comments seem to be serious about their stand or understanding Tamil Nadu. I can assure you that Tamil Nadu is not on the way to becoming the next Kashmir-like situation or all the Dravidian political supporters are separatists. Tamil Nadu has strong economic and political interests in keeping the Indian Union as one Country.

Any Separatists or Insurgency guys are a small minority of politicians and idiots who are hungry for power. I agree there is some serious opposition to various policies of the Modi government such as the Financial Policy and Education policy. Since we are in a Democratic Republic opposition must be there so the Ruling Government will be in check. Certain acts committed by the DMK Government are also not much popular such as the demolition of 08+ Temples.

Strong unity among the States and people is much needed for facing external and internal threats and for continuing in terms of Economic growth too. 

The question of LTTE (Tamil Insurgency Group in Sri Lanka) pesters people a lot it seems. Did the People of Tamil Nadu support LTTE financially and ideologically? Yes, our fathers and Grandfathers have supported them. There is a reason for it Tamil Speaking people in Northern Sri Lanka were stripped of their political and economical rights during the earlier days of the Srilankan Republic that led to the Sri Lankan Civil war. Source: [Origins of the Sri Lankan civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_the_Sri_Lankan_civil_war#:~:text=The%20government%20of%20D.S.,the%20voting%20power%20in%20Parliament..). Do we still support the LTTE, Nah but we support equitable representation for Tamils living in Sri Lanka and citizenship for Tamils who fled the Republic of Srilanka during the Civil war.

And I am curious about how generally people see the State of Tamil Nadu and its inhabitants so comment your thoughts too.

740,The Hijab controversy erupts right before the state elections ?,"A middle class person, who has to go in and vote in the state elections, might consider voting on the basis of lack of development experienced by them in the past years under the government. The working class person, might have a problem with the weakening of unions. The student might have complaint over not having enough buses or roads to reach their colleges. But then suddenly there's an event and all the news channels and social media erupt with the images and videos of first the Muslim identity and then with the images and videos of the Hindu identity. The problems faced by middle class person, a working class person, a student are buried under the flashing banners of a portrayed religious identity conflict. Being over-exposed to, and over-simulated by these banners, people react to them holding one of the religious banner themselves and hence shedding their identities of being a student, a worker, a middle class person. In the constant discussions of their views as a Hindu on whether a Hijab should be allowed or not allowed in schools, their earlier views on development, unions and roads are forgotten. 

For the upcoming 2024 elections, right before the elections, the identity of the Indian would again be invoked and pitched against that of the Pakistani or the Chinese, maybe on something as nonsensical as whether India should cut all trade relations with China, which is again not something viable or something Indians should focus on, but would successfully suppress the discussions about development in the past years.",43,Politics,77f04f12-7ea0-11e3-ac66-22000a0b8292,7

757,A Doctor called me a Defaulter,"This happened today. 

Had a prolonged chest congestion (Jan 2022 onwards) & finally went to a Chest specialist today (North India) who I hate with the bottom of my heart. I was on his meds for about 3 months.
Last visit was unpleasant enough. 
Doc asked what's the problem, i described it in detail & said i discontinued (his meds, mainly inhaler (Seroflo) & Monteculast LX) for this last one week. 

Guy goes off saying I'm a defaulter (skipped medicines) & he doesn't treat defaulters (added that City 
CMO advises against treating patients who are defaulters) 
Wrote 4 tests (xray, blood, etc from his clinic), said was getting late for his lunch FFS & directed me to his receptionist 

I left the place after asking the Receptionist what he wrote in scribbled handwriting on the consultation sheet, he replied ""defaulter patient"", which i honestly want to frame now.

763,SEX EDUCATION:——Indians and foreskin issues(Phimosis)),"Many of the kids and teens in india are not aware of their own body due to lack of sex education, if I would to take a random guess and say about 50% or more of the indian boys do not know that they need to pull back their foreskin and take shower or their are even many people who never ever pulled their foreskin back while masturbating or having sex, if you are the one and never pulled your foreskin then this post will really help you,i got to know about it at 19(age) and i was surprised how come I didn’t know about this also when i used to watch porn all i saw was circumcised penis so never got to know about pulling foreskin back, but when I actually discovered it i tried to do it the issue was i couldn’t pull it all the way back if i try to force the pain i would get was terrible and by doing some research i got to know i had PHIMOSIS(unable to pull foreskin all the way down), i was really scared and thought getting circumcised was the only solution but as i dive into this topic i got to know stretching methods can also help i did that and successfully retracted my foreskin. And now im happy but important thing is that as i was searching about this topic i got to know that majorly teens from india are suffering from this issue and i want to admit this. Sex ed is really important for anyone suffering from this it can be easily solved no need to worry have a good day👍.

Edit:- Many people were asking about the solution and many of them discovered that they have phimosis after this post so for all of them here is the information you need
