US/NATO doesnt need us. China is our enemy so it leaves russia.

I see a lot of people say China-Russia alliance. They dont understand that both are aiming for the top and either will backstab the other as soon as US isnt an issue. So its less of an alliance and more of a temporary truce.

Putin is no better than Modi. Both are fascist scum who needs to be removed. But dont fall for western fear mongering BS either. A strong Russia is beneficial to India the most. We have no other allies in the world stage.",1185,Foreign Relations,"Flair_id    87cac512-1d08-11eb-ad0b-0e5e270e4ce5

142,indian stance on ukraine is morally wrong but ok by international politics.," copying the answer byu/nejxhnake8hfaj and Dense-Throat-5371 because it is exactly my view as well .. I'm pasting his comment here. also the link.. https://np.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t2gm19/india_turns_down_us_persuasion_to_vote_against/hym5n6c/

those who say india did wrong.. please read. You would not be making this comment if you knew about the history. India did the absolutely right thing in this situation.

Russia has been the only ally if India in its trying times, when India was invaded by Pakistan in 1971, where were the US and the NATO countries? Oh right, they were busy supplying arms and ammunition to the AGGRESSOR (Pakistan) in this situation. Russia was the only country that helped us during this time.Times and times the west has ostracized India and refused to help. During the recent skirmishes in the Sino-Indian war, did you see a single nation in the west concerned about us. They told us it's our own internal matter to be dealt with. And now that India doesn't want to participate in a war that would cause a huge loss to them, suddenly they are bad? What hypocrites

Let's move onto geopolitics now, India has Pakistan to it's west and China to it's north, both of them have bad relations with India, now if we vote against Russia our only ally, wouldn't this turn Russia against us as well. Trust me, you don't want three war mongering nations, with nuclear weapons nonetheless, after you.

In addition to this, Russia is the biggest fertilizer supplier to India. India's huge part of economy depends on it's agricultural industry, which is maintained only because the supply of fertilizers from Russia. Now tell me, if we go against Russia and they decided to stop any trade with us, wouldn't it affect India's economy severely? We would literally starve, and I doubt the west will give any fucks about us as if they have given any in the past. United Snakes of America (not an insult to the people but to the government) can't be trusted at all.

You cannot be emotionally driven in your decisions when you have A BILLION people in your country to look after. Trust me, Indians, too, don't want a war, our heart goes to the soldiers of Russia, Ukraine and the poor citizens who got caught in crossfire, but we can't do much, we have already done all we can. And I am sure the diplomats who took this decision surely knows a lot about this topic than me and you*

Well yes. You are indeed correct. But India has 74 years of relations established with Russia. Whereas, with the US we have started establishing major relations for a decade only.

No offense but from a complete political standpoint, India knows it can trust Russia and not someone like US who was responsible (the Nixon Administration) for supporting Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistan war which heavily severed our relations and also terror-funding in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

India is trying its best to go through a middle ground here. Yes, it will look like we are condoning Putin's war crimes but do we truly have a choice here?

Given the past, we cannot trust the west. We can't just outright ""betray"" Russia and make a nuclear power an enemy which is just located above our head. Not to mention, we will also be potentially going against China ( which is pro-Russian in this) and Pakistan (Pro-Russian and heavily influenced by China) and would be left completely bordered.

Just a note, I'm talking about everything from a political point of view and not morally

..
also our first priority is safety of india as a nation and its citizens and for that we need good allys.. tell me what in the opinion of governemtn of india shoudl be a preference... thinking about our own citizens and our nation, or caring about some other nation.. i think our own people come in first priority and then the other nations.. so even if we dont give anti russia or pro russia  statements.. best least we can do it keep mouth shut.

191,India needs to start rapidly militarizing RIGHT NOW!,"Disclaimer: I am an arrogant teenager who has a read a few books and thinks he knows it all, so take my assessment with a grain of salt and agar galat lage to baccha samajhke maaf kardena.

Now, I think this situation is not very good for India in the long term.

The sanctions being imposed on Russia will push it further into China's orbit as it now needs to do business with China even more than before, it does business with India as well but any sane country would ditch India as a business partner in favor of the much wealthier China any day. 

Also this situation has got the ball rolling, it won't result in any massive conflict in the short term but it's ripple effects can very easily result in a massive conflict in a decade or two.

In this case, India is completely encircled. [This is what I think the map of the war would look like](https://imgur.com/a/mN2HMgz) though I could be wrong here. But this is simply a nightmarish scenario for us.

India can't handle a prolonged war with China alone, we can handle a short quick war but we can't handle a long with China, and in this situation we might have to face a two front assault from both Pakistan and China and even maybe Russia.

If we couldn't handle it, the Punjab and the Doab region may get overrun by foreign troops and we might have to retreat into the deccan to continue resistance or surrender.

India needs to buy as many weapons we can, we need to standardize our weaponry and make them compatible with each other, we need to set up a huge military industrial complex to support a prolonged war if it comes to that. We need to start our own RND, we need to do whatever we can to make it out of this century intact.

In my opinion this is an extremely dangerous position we are into and I am very worried.

What do you people think about this? 

Am I wrong in my assessment? 

What would you correct or add to this?

What is your opinion on the situation and the prospects of a war?",0,Foreign Relations,"Flair_id    87cac512-1d08-11eb-ad0b-0e5e270e4ce5

**An Indian-origin woman in Germany was allegedly racially insulted and kicked out of a store when she sought compensation for spoilt milk. Srruthi Lekha, a human rights activist living in Magdeburg, stated that she along with her friend were racially abused by the store management when they had gone to ask for compensation**. She also shared about the incident on Twitter along with a video where her friend is seen being roughed up by the store staff.  

""I had bought milk from Kaufland which got badly spoiled and we got sick so badly. My friend @harsha (also Indian) and I went to Kaufland to enquire about this and ask for an answer and proper compensation. They discussed and offered a compensation of 30 euros. Before we could accept it, the Kaufland employee simply said, go get a lawyer and denied the offer [sic],"" read the screenshot which was shared by Lekha. She further stated that they were neither given the compensation nor the milk bottle. ""We asked for the spoiled milk bottle back so we could go to court with it. But they denied giving it said 'you are in our country and here you can't ask for compensation,'"" she stated adding that they were also abused and asked to get out of the store.",243,Foreign Relations,"Flair_id    87cac512-1d08-11eb-ad0b-0e5e270e4ce5

1. Ukraine and Russian people treat each other like families (with few exceptions obviously), we have seen civilians openly walking to Russian army and not getting killed. This situation doesn't exist in India-China relationship which is driven by pure mutual hate (or so I think).
2. Their conflict is driven by government and that too by Russian government only. Same is not true here, both Indian and Chinese government hate each other and to an extent, so do the people.
3. Ukrainian people seem a lot more united and their leaders a lot more honest, they accept if they lose control of situation, they didn't not immediately leave their capital and hide in a nuclear shelter. I don't think anyone needs me to explain what would our leaders do if this happens.

210,Is it the right time for India to try to stop the war?,"Now that the West is really pushing Russia through sanctions and it's evident Russia can't decisively subdue Ukraine in another week's time with reinforcements coming in (unless Putin literally nukes the country which he can if cornered enough), both Modi and Xi have the opportunity and responsibility to pitch in and persuade Putin to stop and sit at the table of discussion. Russia has already done enough infrastructural damage to Ukraine in 3 days that would take years to rebuild.

When Putin invaded from 3 sides he thought it would take a couple of days to bring Ukraine to their knees. But he underestimated the bravery of Ukrainians. These brave people deserve a chance. Not many countries have people like that. Take Afghanistan and their former leadership, for example.

India can't force, but it can definitely start talking sense to Putin. Modi has a real shot at establishing himself as a world leader and that goes in line with the Indian history, culture and heritage. That would put us in a more acceptable position with the West as well as Russia which is in caution zone economicially. Modi can do that. And the time is now.

People who compare Ukraine and Pakistan are living in a fool's world. Pakistan is a nuclear-power where democracy is at the mercy of the military. That's not Ukraine. Ukraine's dilemma is whether to hold hands with the devil in the West or the East. That's a pitiful position. Put yourself at the position of Zelenskyy with a divided country and sandwiched between two major powers.

Silently watching a significantly weaker nation (in terms of military) fight alone (whatever may be the reason... Ukraine's history has been highly unstable, they deserve a chance to a better tomorrow) and get wiped for all the wrong reasons is a crime. Putin is ex-KGB and that instinct tilts him towards a win at any cost over the cost of human lives. India isn't that. Our leaders shouldn't become that. History won't forgive us if we let Putin continue doing this and do nothing about it when we can definitely be more active than abstaining from voting or remaining indifferent. We should make a real effort.

Maybe that's why you need a powerful opposition in democracy. I wonder why no opposition leader is pushing for continued talks with Russia towards ending this manslaughter.

Make no mistake, the world is only becoming more and more violent. The taste of blood is ever-delicious. If we remain silent today, it becomes a part of our history.

212,People are coming around but i guess the damage is done for India in international front already.,"For past week i have witnessed countless excuses as to why India's choice to abstain was geopolitically right. We are in boat surrounded by sharks along our borders and why rock the boat. I have been very loud in my concerns with the neutral stance and why it doesn't make sense for this particular situation. But people were not receptive to the idea. We turned our back on the world just to not antagonize anyone. But were we the only one in such a precarious situation, nope, there's afganistan, swedan, swiss, finland and many other nations. But they did the right thing inspite of that. Now as china reverts his statement on Russia we are isolated in our actions. Global community won't forget this, we will be prejudiced around the world. And what does it end up acheiving us? Nothing!!!

Now, what's left will be the consequences. The indian community and students in ukraine are already facing the ire there. Even russian soldiers abducting indian girls and shooting. I have been watching videos of those stranded there inside the city with no communication from embassy and their point of contact. Godi media doing propoganda on the ground there and cutting off as soon as indian people speak on live telecast. Modi is doing pr at home with big roundtable conferences. Ministers doing photoops with those few that returned. And our prime. Minister saying they should have done further studies in India. Maybe if we were active we would have had made some arrangements with the neighbouring countries to pick our country men. Arranged buses or trains for them on a bigger scale. Even pakistan has been able to swiftly move their people out as per those videos. While our government is busy assigning names to the operation. This government abondoned their citizens on foreign soil because of their incompetence and indifference. And people cheered their cowardice on the global front with all sorts of excuses. 

Now where does this leave us?",1,Foreign Relations,"Flair_id    87cac512-1d08-11eb-ad0b-0e5e270e4ce5

218,ELI5 why Modi government isn't rushing the Jaishankar and his team to Poland and Hungary to work with Poland and Ukraine and Hungary to bring back Indians?,"Depute the team there, hire like 500 buses, put them all in these buses and ship them out of Poland. These are middle class kids who have gone abroad to study during a war. They aren't taking any sides and they (and their families) don't deserve this stupid pain over a white man's war that India has nothing to do with.  
 
It is 100% not their fault or responsibility to have not fled Ukraine or their cities/universities during the lead up to the war - money doesn't grow on trees and everything was uncertain a week ago. Putin was supposed to invade at 4 am on one day, then 4 am on another day, and so on.  
  
I understand Europeans being too harebrained and racist to sympathize with Indians (and Africans and Pakistanis) caught in this dilemma, but I don't understand why the government is not publicly appealing to Russia and Ukrainian forces to provide safe passage to non-nationals who are not involved in this.  
  
Whichever party helps India will win a huge wave of support in India for sure. If the Ukrainians guarantee safe passage to Indian nationals, then the Modi government will be hard pressed to explain why they're still teetering towards Russia.  
  
If Russia helps them, then they've once again won us over as a staunch ally for the next 40 years.  
  
This is so irritating. Just get the kids out, they're like just 24ish on average, not 40 year old men and women who should know better. Don't throw them to the vagaries of the IFS officers sitting and drinking chai paani in Warsaw.",1,Foreign Relations,"Flair_id    87cac512-1d08-11eb-ad0b-0e5e270e4ce5

Wanakam everyone! Moving a bit away from some heavier topics (usually) discussed here, I have a query.

Might be a bit offtopic but is there someplace where can I (and I'm pretty sure a lot of my fellow motorsport fans) get some (add: cool) F1 merch here in India. Preferably offline ofcourse.

Also I know a lot of people follow Cricket, football and tennis in this country and I've also seen a lot of Indians on the F1 subreddits. So let's have a chat here right?

What do you think about the upcoming new regs? New Cars? What about the Abu Dhabi controversy? Are you a MV33 or LH44 or Perhaps a Charles LeClrec fan? I'd love to see a fellow countryman or Countrywoman's opinion on it given that SADDA PLAN is on the way (read about Jehan Daruvala).

How did you get into the sport? If you have no idea what it's about I'm here to help. 

What do you take away from all the racing you see? What do you feel about Indian drivers acting like wanna be Sebastian Vettels on the Indian roads?

Hopefully this doesn't violate any rules. XOXOXO",0,Sports,"Flair_id    82ac768c-3174-11e5-950c-0e3f27028b2f

280,Disheartened to not see a better performance from India in the Olympics (Winter and Summer),"I feel disheartened to see that India, a country with the second highest population in the world, has failed to accomplish anything in the Olympics. I understand that as a poor country we have a lack of amenities and our society values a stable mediocre life to a riskier one but I feel that we are in some part to blame too. We have never been rebellious enough to focus on our goals and always had faith in the judgement of our elders, but it is clear to see that this Indian attitude fails to reward personal experiences in favor of family. I know that things are starting to improve and India is increasing its tally in the Summer Olympics, but I personally feel that this progress is too slow as athletics would have to start at a younger level and be part of the academic curriculum to be competitive enough in the future. Amenities would need to be provided to our athletes and I think the Indian community would have to become more self-conscious on our goals as a nation. We can at least talk about and create a discussion on this topic which I know would be in the minds of some who are watching the Winter Olympics. What do you think about this and what are your suggestions on improving this?",0,Sports,"Flair_id    82ac768c-3174-11e5-950c-0e3f27028b2f

**Pitch and conditions**

The first round of the T20 World Cup saw the UAE fixtures take place in Abu Dhabi, but the pitch in Dubai is expected to favour the slower bowlers. Even the quicks are likely best served by varying their pace and bowling more cutters than express pace, with lower scores likely to be competitive.

295,2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup - India's best chance to qualify for a FIFA World Cup on merit,"India is hosting the 2022 Women's Asian Cup which starts from 20th Jan played across 3 venues in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Pune. 12 Teams from Asia will be competing for the cup. Unlike the men's tournament the Asian Cup doubles up as qualifiers for the FIFA Women's World Cup. The teams are divided in three groups of 4 teams each. The top 2 teams in each group qualify for the quarter finals. Also the two best 3rd placed teams will also play the quarter finals. Do join us on r/IndianFootball as we will host Match Threads for the game.

&#x200B;

##Why is it India's best chance to qualify for FIFA World Cup on merit?

For a number of reasons,

1. Asia has 6 Direct slots and 2 Inter-continental playoff spots for 2023 FIFA World cup. So in a 12 Team tournament, 50% of the teams get a direct qualification to the World Cup. 

2. Strong teams like North Korea, Uzbekistan and Jordan are not part of this tournament because they withdrew from qualifiers or didn't top their qualifier groups

3. India's Group - We are drawn with China, Taiwan and Iran in the group. Since up to 3 teams can get out of the group India has a good chance to make it to the quarterfinals. India can also draw inspiration from recent results vs Iran and Taiwan. India defeated Taiwan 1-0 a few months back in a friendly and also defeated Iran 1-0 in 2019 when Iran came to India to play in a friendly tournament. However both of these matches were very close and none of the teams can be considered favorites in these fixtures. As the coach himself has said, the target for the team is to get to the quarterfinals. China have been historically very strong in women's football. In recent times they have lost some of their domination but it would be a huge upset if India can get a result vs China.

4. Host Advantage - Familiarity with the conditions, weather and the pitch would at least put the home team at ease compared to others arriving from overseas.

If India win the quarter-final tie they directly qualify for the World Cup. Even if India lose, the quarterfinal losers will play each other and the two winner's of this tie will qualify for the world cup. So if India face an impossible hurdle in quarterfinals and are drawn against a team like South Korea they still have a chance to make it to the world cup. Since Australia are the 2023 World Cup hosts the above format of world cup qualification only takes place if Australia reach the semi-finals in the Asian Cup. This is the most likely scenario, for details of the other two scenarios you can read [this great article by ESPN](https://www.espn.in/football/afc-asian-cup/story/4572243/afc-womens-asian-cup-2022-all-you-need-to-know)

[Official list of International Broadcasters](https://www.the-afc.com/en/national/afc_womens_asian_cup/where_to_watch.html)


##The Squad

**Goalkeepers:** Aditi Chauhan (1), Maibam Linthoingambi Devi (23), Sowmiya Narayanasamy (19).

**Defenders:** Dalima Chhibber (17), Sweety Devi Ngangbam (2), Ritu Rani (21), Loitongbam Ashalata Devi (4), Manisa Panna (3), Hemam Shilky Devi (5), Sanju Yadav (8).

**Midfielders:** Yumnam Kamala Devi (6), Anju Tamang (9), Karthika Angamuthu (20), Nongmeithem Ratanbala Devi (7), Naorem Priyangka Devi (14), Indumathi Kathiresan (12).

**Forwards:** Manisha Kalyan (16), Grace Dangmei (11), Pyari Xaxa (10), Renu (15), Sumati Kumari (22), Sandhiya Ranganathan (13), Mariyammal Balamurugan (18)

##Players to Watch

It is a very young squad, with the average age of 23. Aditi Chauhan is the first choice goalkeeper and an experienced member of the sqaud. We also did an [AMA with Aditi](https://np.reddit.com/r/IndianFootball/comments/ao3pa6/i_am_aditi_chauhan_captain_and_goalkeeper_for_the/) a few years ago. Ashalata Devi captains the team and is another experienced presence. In the attack India has the trio of Manisha, Dangmei Grace and Pyari Xaxa who are rapid! The have terrific pace and fitness and can do some damage on the counter attack. However India is sadly missing Bala Devi due to an ACL injury. She was the AIFF Women's Player of the year who went to Scotland and played for Rangers. Overall it is going to be tough challenge for the girls, the opening fixture vs Iran is going to be crucial since on paper that is the most winnable fixture.",48,Sports,"Flair_id    82ac768c-3174-11e5-950c-0e3f27028b2f

296,Did you guys know that Andrew Garfield used to be a Cricket coach?,"In the new interview of him with Entertainment Tonight he was mainly talking about his reaction towards returning one of his favourite CB character and how he loved being a part of Spider-Man NWH and working besides Tobey and Tom. He also said about passing of his mother(RIP) prior to his awesome movie Tick Tick Boom and how it affected him in a good way. Then the host and AG was talking about his career before acting, how he was struggled a lot while getting a chance for acting where he mentioned that he coached cricket in his 20s and that was unexpected. I know he knows about cricket, I've seen a video of him promoting TASM2 in IPL i think and if i remember he played some beautiful shots too. After finding out that he coached in Cricket, i find it interesting to share this with everyone.

327,Why Indians don't do well at Olympics?," I checked out some profile of athletes competing in Olympics 2020. And I realised that most of them are very highly educated, especially people from developed countries. Many young athletes are starting their education at top colleges. William Shaner, who won gold medal for USA in 10m Air rifle, is a kid pursuing engineering at University of Kentucky. 

Anna Kiesenhofer, who won god medal for Austria in cycling, is a Post Doctorate in Mathematics at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. Before that, she did her masters in University of Cambridge. 

Charlotte HYM, who is competing for France in skateboarding, has a PHD in neuroscience. I mean just imagine if any of the middle class Indian kids tell to their parents that they are doing Skateboarding. They would just simply not accept. 

It is quite encouraging that these people get scholarships due to their athletic abilities in top colleges, but if people are doing their PhDs and stuff, then that means they are also genuinely interested in the subjects. They aren’t in top colleges just because they are good at certain sports. 

Thats the issue with Indian education. First, colleges don’t accept athletic abilities while considering admissions Second, Indians think if you are concentrating on sports, then that means you are trading off your education. They think its a zero sum game, when it is clearly not.",2228,Sports,"Flair_id    82ac768c-3174-11e5-950c-0e3f27028b2f

436,My neighbors poisoned my cats,"In Aligarh in a society my next door neighbors used to scare, beat and run after my cats everywhere they saw them  I just used to ignore them as they would start doing it more just to tease me this was going on for the laat couple of years but since the past week they started to fight with me regarding the cats even then I wouldn't fight with them and would say that if they don't like them they can keep them away from their garden but except that it's not their property they can freely roam around and go wherever they want. Just 5 days after they threatened us that we will kill your cats just like they had previously brutally killed a dog in the society a few weeks back. Just few days after One of my 4 month old cat passed away and the other 7 months old is severly ill. The kitten had vomiting just for one day which was only white mucus and the other one had the same symptoms from what we made out they were given poison or some kind of deadly chemical. How can I take action against them what can I do to bring justice to the poor small animal as these people are not stoping first they killed a dog then cats and what now humans?

As I was writing this a message came on the colony group that tomorrow a meeting will be held to make rules and regulations for stray cats and dogs from what they have done till now the rules are gonna be beat stray dogs with sticks till they die and poison the cats cause that's the solution they have.",264,Crime,"Flair_id    a4b368ae-6655-11ec-8f46-de0cfdda1277

438,I was assaulted this afternoon by an Uber driver on the side of the road. Nobody helped. I need help.,"Hi, this is a throwaway account for my safety.

I'm M, 26, native English speaker.

I took an Uber this afternoon in Bangalore. The driver argued mid-trip (because I complained the car was dirty) and tried to restrain me inside the car. I ran out of the car forcefully, but he got out and assaulted me on the side of the road.

He hit me at least 10 times on the head and shoulders, cycling repeatedly. I did not hit back at all. It was rural Bangalore area, and no bystander helped me. I yelled for help but they all stood silent; he kept hitting me. He gave me death threats and tried to snatch my phone. I suffered injuries on my shoulder.

I have pictures of him assaulting me with the cab's plate visible.

Everyone suggested that since I don't speak their native tongue, and look like a white dude from a different region, I should go back and not complaint because I will get harassed further. I feel scared and helpless.

Uber support just disabled his account - no further help.

I'm in a state of shock. I don't have anyone in Bangalore; I just work a job here. I'm alone, scared and feel humiliated. What can I do? I'd appreciate any inputs.

**Edit**: Thank you for all the support. Plenty of kind folks have responded (including lawyers). Few people have asked me how did it unfold, to which I've replied **[here](https://np.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/sfgiyl/i_was_assaulted_this_afternoon_by_an_uber_driver/hupyp6d/)**.

440,Mall parking lot horror story,"Adding the crime flair because I'm pretty sure this is a crime. 

This happened yesterday at 6pm, in the parking lot of Greater Noida's Ansal Plaza Mall. 
My boyfriend and i were in his car, chilling, cuddling, and eating our takeaway order, which was parked in the corner of a completely secluded, dark and empty lot.  

Suddenly, 3 men with flashes on, start banging at the car door and windows and attempt pulling the door handles. They were also rubbing the windshield since the car windows were completely fogged up . Since there was no visibility, and we also had blinds on the windows, we were worried that these guys are some criminals trying to loot us or just miscreants. We were scared out of our senses and contemplated just driving away from this mess, when one of the men said ""bahar aa jaiye, hame baat karni hai, hamne video bana li hai"". 

My boyfriend grew concerned of my safety and decided to roll down the windows and talk to them. We asked them if they wanted money(if they were thieves), or if we were doing something wrong and if they wanted to inspect the vehicle (in case they thought we were consuming drugs or illegal). They asked him to step out and ""leave madam inside, we won't do anything to her"". 

I could hear them asking completely pointless questions to him (where do you stay, what do your parents do, what college do you go to, where is it) and i figured that they aren't the police. I stepped out and asked them who they were, and if they were not the police how could they detain us. One of the guys , the agressive one, said yes, and i demanded to see his ID. He refused. I asked ""by what law are you not showing me your ID? Is this Pakistan where Indian laws don't apply? And if you are a cop, you know what I'm talking about, and if you don't show me an ID right now I will take you to court"" . His accomplice, a calmer man, but dressed in all black outfit like the agressive one, said ""madam aap shant ho jaiye, ham sir se baat kar rahe hai. You don't have to get involved in this"". The agressive guy gestured to me and told calm guy that he'll have to call ""inspector sahab of xyz police station"" now since ""they are not cooperating"" and did a complete charade of dialing a number and putting the phone to his ear. My boyfriend was still trying to co-operate with these thugs and asked if there's a video, since he was afraid of his car's numberplate being filmed and used to trace him. They said "" Sir you have to come to the office and we'll show you"". This terrified me because if they took him away, i don't know who else would come for me and my 5'3 ass can not protect myself from men with with sticks. 

I called up my friend who's studying to be a lawyer, and told him about this situation. These thugs got alarmed and forced my boyfriend to tell me to ""not call the police because we are settling things"". I didn't give two shits to their offer and proceeded to talk to my friend. He told me that they can't film me or use it to blackmail us, because filming a woman without her consent is a criminal offense, and hugging or kissing isn't an offense even if done in public. I also realised that the sun had set now, and i couldn't be arrested even if they called the police. I dared them now to call the police, and that if they had my video, i will get them arrested for filming me without my permission. They now threatened to call our parents, we insisted that we are legal adults and can deal with this on our own. 

These guys were clearly confounded now and kept persuading my boyfriend to send me back to the car. He could see that they had run out of moves. He asked them one more time ""you made the video, show it to me, don't show it to her if you're not comfortable"". The men just looked at each other confused. Since both of us realised that their bluff had been caught and they were out of moves, we sat in our car and went our way. 

They didn't stop us after that. 

Tl, Dr/Moral of the story: 
Do not panic
Know your rights.

443,New Scam,"I was saved from getting scammed worth 10k, time of incidence 9:24pm 13th January 2022.

I was waiting for bus under Rajaji Nagar Metro station(Bus timing was 9.30pm). A guy on bike approached me, he said he forgot his card and if I could withdraw some money for him and he would send me over Gpay or Phonepe.

He looked well groomed and decent by in language and personality. I decided to help him, the ATM was a bit far from the bus stop and he took me there on his bike. I withdrew 10k as he asked and was waiting for him to show the transfer confirmation. He showed me a Screenshot and at the same time my bus arrived. I asked him if we could go near the bus stand as I didn't want to miss my bus.

Upon reaching the bus station He asked me to click a picture of the SS and give him the amount. I cleared denied stating unless I see the amount reflecting in my account I won't give him the cash, incase if the amount is debited later on, I would send it back to same account and I proceed to get on the bus. 

Once on bus, I checked the SS and it showed all my details were correct except one small thing, the time transaction was 8.34pm which is almost an hr before our encounter.

I called in 112 to report the incident, the help desk asked me to report it to nearest police station. I mentioned I'm on bus traveling and they forwarded me the contact of the police station.

At the pressure of missing the bus, I might have handled him the money. But something didn't feel right, my instincts saved me. Hope no-one gets scammed by people like these.

471,"Messed up really bad, need advice (Cyber Fraud)","So this morning I was in a meeting (WFH) when my mother handed me here phone saying it's Uncle FGH on other side.

This FGH is a known person who usually asks for money. So today also he requested some money on PhonePe while on call. But I later discovered that it was some fraudster who impersonated FGH.

I was very focused into the meeting so didn't pay attention to whom I was sending the money.
I sent around ~40k rupees. 

This is a significant amount for me to lose. My mental health has already been bad since past few days - probably why I wasn't able to notice this obvious scam.

I figured out the scam as soon as the call was closed. And reached out to National Cyber Security Cell - they have registered my complaint. I also gave this complaint no. to my local HDFC Bank branch to report this fraudulent transaction - they have also began an internal investigation.

Now my question is -
What are the chances that I'll get my money back?
Because none the Cyber Cell or HDFC have said anything whether I will ever get my money back.

Edit- Can you please tell me where to file the RBI complaint? 
I see online they are saying I should only file a complaint with them if my issues are not resolved by concerned authorities (Cyber Police, HDFC) within 30 days.",38,Crime,"Flair_id    a4b368ae-6655-11ec-8f46-de0cfdda1277

So many scammers, scam centers. There are so many scammers that can be easily caught with some easy tracking done by their phone number, the government doesn't do anything. 

If this continues, Indians will face heavy racism in other countries. Just thinking of it, Indians are already facing it due to the thick accent, brown screen and looks. Now basically add the scamming where foreigners have lost their life savings, they'd basically want us dead. 

This is actually worse than the terrorist organisations, doing more damage to the reputation of India. 

Those scammers are making millions and no one to stop. 

I went to the government page to report the scam, the page looks like it's designed by an engineering student who just learnt HTML. 

Something must be done, else brown skinned Indians guys need to forget about going to Western countries. I am feeling so ashamed. Where we could be respected for our beautiful culture and our values and hospitality towards others, we are labelled as scammers.

491,Indian Army Rental Scam,"So I had a property for rent, it's a run down 3 BHK in a decent part of town. I had posted ads on a few sites like Magic Bricks and No Broker but I dint have many responses. I decided to post my property on 99 Acres as well, and that's when the fun started. 

The moment I posted an ad on 99 acres, I got a call from Commander Pankaj Kumar Pandey from the Indian armed forces. He said that his wife saw this ad and since he is being transferred here from Bombay, he is VERY interested in this flat and wants to take it up immediately. For a second I was happy but I was reminded of something that I saw and we will get to that a little later. I knew this was too good to be true and decided to play along. He proceeded to message me on WhatsApp within a few mins and asked me for the images of my property once again. He then told me that he would like to go ahead with this and asked for my PayTM number to send the advance payment. I sent him the same and he proceeded to call me asking me to open my PayTM. He then sent me an image from another number that had a QR code in it. He told me to open my scanner in PayTM and scan the image that he had just sent over. 

That's when I stopped playing around and abused the shit out of him. I don't think he would have heard such colorful words in his scamming career. It felt amazing!

What would have happened if I had scanned this image? They would have scammed me for Rs 50k to 1L (Also depends on how much you have in your account) 

These people have been at it for a few years now and I found numerous articles just by searching 'Army rent scam' on Google - https://www.the420.in/rent-scam-fraudster-posing-as-army-officer-dupes-bhopal-man-of-rs-1-lakh/#:~:text=Sign%20in-,Rent%20Scam%3A%20Fraudster%20Posing%20As%20Army%20Officer%20Dupes,Man%20Of%20Rs%201%20Lakh&text=In%20his%20police%20report%2C%20he,to%20be%20an%20Army%20soldier

People have also been posting on the 99 acres - https://www.99acres.com/ask-fraud-605853.html - saying the same thing.

Bank have given a Negative response saying that I shared an OTP whereas I didnt. So whats next?

Also, I am ready to pay genuinely if anyone here can help me recover the money. Thanks!

507,A New Scam! Through Speedpost!,"So we received an envelope through Speedpost today addressed to my father with the return address stamped as ""N.O.S.P.L 20 Armenian Street Kolkata 700001"". In it was a letter from ""Ayurvedic Sansthan"" and a scratch card. The letter claimed that he (my father) is the winner of a lucky draw on the occasion of the organisation's birthday and our prize would be decided by the scratch card. It also claimed that the prize money was guaranteed by their *banking parter,* HSBC Bank. The scratch card revealed that we had won INR 12.5 lakh. The letter further went on to state that in order to claim said prize, we are to contact them though WhatsApp on 9903482257 (nobody answers upon calling). The caveat? The charge levied for processing *""will be collected in advance and will no be adjusted against the prize money under any circumstances"".* The letter also included a small deposit form asking for account information and was signed by ""Finance Manager Mr. Pankaj Agrawal""

It was an obvious scam of-course so we all had a nice laugh. But what really bothered me was that they knew our home address along with my father's name which I found creepy and slightly alarming. Dad is planning on reporting it to the local police station just in case.

510,"My mom got scammed and lost Rs 62,000 today. Can anything be done?","This is how it all happened

I stay in a different city. Back home my maternal grandmother is sick and came to stay with my mom. A relative of ours who is a doctor suggested availing a service from Dhani to get a test done. (We had availed this service earlier once last month and everything went smoothly the last time, and the payment was done to the guy's Gpay number who came to take the samples.)

What happened this time:

This time the guy who came to take the samples asked to pay the amount through Dhani's app itself. My mom was unable to find the link on the app, so she tried to get in touch with customer care and google-searched for Dhani's customer care number. She clicked on this site [https://fanlnk.to/4011603qVElul](https://fanlnk.to/4011603qVElul) and clicked on call. It connected her to a woman. She convinced her that she was from Dhani and told her to download Anydesk mobile app from playstore. She then asked my mom for her device ID to get access to her phone. Next, she tells her to open GooglePay and told mom to scan the debit card front and back. In 4 transactions to MobiKwik, they take out Rs 62,743 from the account and end the call.

What actions were taken:

Both mom and my brother went to the bank immediately and got the debit card blocked. Then filed a cybercrime complaint with details of the transactions. Then went on to lodge a written FIR. On the way to the police station, this scammer calls back and tells to give access again so that the amount can be refunded. When she realized that we knew it was a scam she proudly tells my brother that she will also clear if there is still any amount left.

&#x200B;

The number that they used to call is still working. When we call, they pick up, abuse, and end the call. Their mobile number is the only link. Can anything be done?

Edit:

**Thank you all for your replies. Here is an update:**

My mother and brother went to the local police station to file the FIR (for some reason, they didn't fill it out yesterday, lethargic maybe). The senior inspector there gave them a very generic overview of scams happening with the AnyDesk application. He told my mother why she installed the application in the first place. And then there were many interruptions made while they were having a conversation. He was busy with other work and later asked my family to leave. My mother believes that the team there did not appear to be very energetic. They said they would inform us once they had a lead. In addition, my family called the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal for the follow-up. They said that the amount was already used. The scammers purchased some products and paid some rent, he said. He also said if the lost amount is above Rs 1 lakh, they will investigate this case, else the local police will have to take up the case. Also, my mother made a complaint at the bank today, because yesterday we did not have an FIR. The bank manager said that he would report this issue to the respective authority that handles all the scams. He made them fill out a form and showed sympathy.",69,Crime,"Flair_id    a4b368ae-6655-11ec-8f46-de0cfdda1277

I entered all my details login id, password, pan card, aadhar card, dob. I got alerted when I received a message that my password has been changed and got a otp for a transaction of 25k. That’s when I understood all of this is a scam. After I exited that website, that scammer had the audacity to call me ask if I am facing any problem with this. I wanted to shout at that low-life loser, but did not and complained in the cybercrime website.

In Truecaller, these numbers are already marked as “bank fraud” numbers.

It’s also my stupidity that I believed the sms to be true and did not see the red flags.

The sms - “Dear Customer Your SBI YONO account has been suspended today please update your PAN Card Immediately via link”

1) The text came from a personal number instead of a SBI id. Should’ve have suspected this here itself.
2) The link provided was not a authentic sbi link, but the entire ui of it was exactly the same as sbi. This was another red flag that I should have understood.
3) The details I was entering in this link were used to access my actual account in SBI. I was careless to not suspect it in 1) &amp; 2) itself. I only got aware of the scam when I received a mail from sbi saying that my account password has been changed.

Although I did not lose any money, now, I know the cost of being stupid, hasty, and ignorant. This was a totally avoidable situation.

Then I received the call from ""sir"". Although I am 25, I have a very child like voice. So, this guy assumes I am a kid and he sends me a message on Paytm that says ""payment received from indian army of rs 1"" and asks me to click on pay button underneath and enter the amount that will mean accepting his payment.

534,Vegetarianism in India is not morally superior. It has nothing to do with morality or ethics.,"My family is vegetarian. Consumption of meat based food by others was treated with disgust. I initially believed their reasoning - that it was cruel to animals, that it was not right to cause harm to another living thing, etc. But then they were also uncomfortable with eating food at a restaurant that also had meat dishes on the menu. They disliked vegetarian food being cooked in utensils that had been used to prepare meat dishes. Egg doesn't even have any meat but was still considered a bad thing to eat.

As I grew up, I realized that vegetarianism for them, and society at large, was about maintaining an imagined purity that had been bestowed upon them by virtue of being born in an upper caste lineage. Since butchering, skinning and tanning of animals is considered the occupation of untouchables/outcastes, for an upper caste person to partake in it means risking the ritual purity or caste based superiority. Disgust towards a meat based diet is actually disgust towards the section of our society (Dalits, Muslims) who consume it. Among Gujarat's upper castes, someone who eats non-vegetarian food is considered a baser person, someone who has not quite adopted human values and norms.

The vegetarian sort is fine with the exploitation of livestock for milk. They are okay with cows being pumped with steroids, with male calves being culled for being unproductive, old cows being let loose on the streets, with cattle starving to death in cow shelters.  Even this pretense of humaneness is restricted to animals. Jains/upper caste Hindus who harp about the moral superiority of their food are the vote banks of a political party which has caused widespread massacres. Denying Muslims and Dalits permission to reside in their localities, forcibly stopping the sale of meat on Jain/Hindu holy days, removing eggs from the mid day meals of school kids, banning the slaughter of cattle does not strike these people as violence being committed on their fellow humans. It is such people who constitute and support a party that overtly states its goal to be the subjugation of the 'other'. Protesting the loss of life in pogroms, mob lynching, caste based violence or fake encounters as a community never occurs to devout Jains/upper caste Hindus. Spilling the blood of people they consider inferior does not shake their faith. 

This explains why upper caste Hindus/Jains are so obsessed with vegetarianism, so much so as to label the normal food of the masses, that is contrary with their own practices, as ""non-vegetarian"". It's merely a performance. Those who call the cow their mother, consume its dung and urine, or claim vegetarianism as superior have no great love for animals or ethical living. Vegetarianism is merely a vehicle to project and maintain superiority over the lower caste masses. It makes it easier to think of yourself as a good person while ill treating those who have no power to fight back.",4506,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

My mother in law is two faced. 

My father in law is not going to say anything.

May be life is just an end-less sadness one way or other.

539,We need a antiwork sub for India,"Indians middle class is much more fucked than others. Most of us live paycheck to paycheck. Every wonder what will happen when we will retire? (We probably can't) we work 9-12 hours 5 days a week. Sometimes 6 days a week. We don't have any personal life. Can't even rent a good house forget owning one.  

Bosses treat employees like shit, harassments and misconduct happens all the time and we just ignore because we cant actually do anything. We need a place to discuss all of that somewhere. 

Where we can forget our religious differences, our sex, age, political ideology and discuss only one thing. Fighting the class system. How people at the top just fuck us all the time.

This is the most important battle, all other battles are just distraction to not let us focus on the main thing

540,"Why do people dismiss when I say I don’t want kids? Why is it so funny/alarming to an overly populated, struggling country?","Married and ‘of age’(lol) here. Female too. “Concerned” folks from the family/society feel like it’s their birthright to ask me why I’m not procreating (Not the husband, only me. As if Imma masturbate a child right out). After all it has been 3 years to the marriage and my “honeymoon period” is supposed to be over by now.

The country is going to the dogs. We are bursting round the seams with people. Jobs are scanty. One has to plan the kid’s life trajectory before conceiving them so that they don’t end up uneducated and depressed. We’ve properly exhausted and ruined every resource including air and water, what the hell do you bring more people to the Earth for? To eat shit? When I think about it, half of our issues wouldn’t  exist as a nation if maybe we weren’t fighting for smaller and smaller pieces of the same pie.

Also last but not the least - Kids. Are. Expensive. 

Why then does every Aunty/uncle laugh on my face or express disdain at my ‘immaturity’ like I’m being ‘wild’ and ‘woke’ when I say I don’t want kids, ever? Like Auntyji if you hadn’t popped out 5 kids in the hope of having a son, mayyybe we would have had more of the world left to enjoy. 

Literally being chastised for enjoying “meaningless” sex with my own husband at this point lmao. People who dole out advice to others like this, seriously STFU and take your crap elsewhere. My bedroom isn’t up for your chai time discussion.

542,The homophobia in India,"So recently I(M) got a boyfriend. Things were going great. Until on Valentines' day, he tells me a girl kissed him. We then talked about what he plans to do. And he says the thing that shook me.

>We can be friends but at the end we are marrying a girl.

And why I asked, he said due to the society and to keep his parents happy.

He is willing to marry a girl despite not having any interest in it? He is not willing to even fight for it. And to blame is the continuous negative attitude of our society towards it.

And it's sad. We need in India a strong LGBTQ+ movement cause the compromise he is forced to make is most likely not only his story alone but might be of many Lgbtq+ members of our society.

Also, let's address another elephant in the room he is from the most progressive state UP.

545,My parents caught me and it's ruining my life.,"So long story short, I lied to my parents to spend a day with a guy I've liked for a while and ended up getting caught. 

Elaborating further, I like a guy and he flew down to visit and work in my city. He was here for the weekend and I really wanted to spend a night with him. For me, I'm a 21F with a super orthodox, conservative family. Drinking, mingling with boys, etc is strictly forbidden. 
So while my parents agreed for the sleepover, I'm sure they had a hunch about it. And I too kept second guessing my decision. 

So basically I got drunk, and accidentally answered my mom's call. Not just that, I left it on for 10 WHOLE minutes. I rushed home. But there on I was SCREWED. 

They caught their pitch perfect daughter drinking and asking a boy to kiss him! So I get what they found out about me must be a shock. But it's now pretty much ruined the freedom and credibility I built over my lifetime. Dealing with a lot of harsh comments, physical abuse and restrictions. 

Tbh, I don't feel like what I've done is exactly wrong, as it's a part of growing up and I really liked the guy. What sort of reaction would you expect from your parents and how would you deal with a situation like mine? 

I mean anger was expected, I don't blame them, but they're stretching it too far.",1168,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

546,Ugly people got no respect or rights!,"I am sharing my personal story here, don't know whether it will help me come out of my terrible situation but still let's hope for the best. 
Since childhood, I was hated and judged for the way I looked. People made fun of me and took my picture without my permission( that still happens even today). 
Things went horribly wrong when during new standard I was the only boy in the class with 20 girl classmates. One girl had some serious problem with the way I looked and since she was good friends with others, she made their friends go against me. Slowly as the months went by, the hatred and disgust for my face grew to the point that she didn't wanted to come to class just because I was there.
I was immensely shy and conscious kid and still am so  after I managed to gather courage and talk to the whole class about what was going on, that girl started crying and said that I was deliberately targeting her. After standing there in front of the whole class for 1 hour trying to speak and during that whole time I was blaming myself for the problem that maybe my behavior in school before this new standard began like wearing mask in school etc may have caused problem. 
Next day, I said that I was going to leave the school and shift to some different city. 
After some months, I developed paranoid and schizophrenic thoughts that the world is trying to kill me and I was admitted in hospital for 2-3 months. Fortunately I survived and my college years were the same like what happened in school, classmates having problem with me for the way I looked. 
This hatred for my face is not confined to just people in school/ college but literally everywhere I go. Strangers looking at me with disgust and laughing at my face. Whether walking down the street, going to see a movie( I go alone because I have no friends), anywhere I go I feel unwanted and judged.
I have been taking medicines for a long time now, tried doing exercise, eat less junk food but I couldn't maintain it for long. Now at this point, I don't know whether I would be ever be able to overcome this fear of people and finally beat this anxiety. This problem have made me take those decisions in life which have definitely changed my life outcomes like not performing well in academics even when I could have studied. 
I was thinking whether there are more people like me in this world and if there are, I really hope to make my own community of ugly people and fight for our rights as well. After all every human being regardless of religion, gender, nationality, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical appearance etc should be treated equally.",429,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

It got fishy , I told him I will pay only once I get my money comes into my account. His reaction entirely changed and started scolding me with bad words and threatening me.

He has my details phone number, name , the place I stay . I reported the same to swiggy they are giving their regular machine replies .

549,"Unpopular opinion - People who create social media accounts for their toddlers, I hope your kid grows up and sues your attention-seeking ass","Just the caption. It’s laughable and annoying anyway to see the dumping ground social media has become for anything and everything on your camera roll. 

But what’s most horrific is that in the vile world we live in, where privacy is clearly an imaginary concept, people not only share the most private images of their kids (without their permission ofcourse), but also subject them to second-hand embarrassment/jokes/bullying for future. 

Creating a whole separate page for the child with cringe captions should be an offence IMHO. Even if I ignore the fact that I’m more interested in a wooden table than I’m in your silly, very-regular child, it snatches away the agency and privacy of a future adult in more ways than one can begin to imagine.

Unfortunately, one of our beloved cats has fallen a prey of this a hole's pyramid fornication scheme and is now pregnant with at least four litters. 
This guy comes to meet her frequently only to fulfil his desires. I have tried to shoo him off with slippers and jhaadu. I have taught my dog and her silent lover to bark and chase that guy if he is seen in this area. I have sat the cat down and gave her 20 minutes lecture on how she can grow and be a purrfectly happy kitty without this one in her life. But nothing is working. 
Yesterday I lost all my patience as she has tried to smuggle him in our home and, that useless guy tried to win the game by purring and rubbing his cheeks on my arm while the fool girl was sitting on my lap. 
Now tell me how do I keep this fu*kboi out of her life. I considered neutering her but by the time we came out of quarantine and could take her to hospital that guy has already put buns in her oven. Now we can only neuter her after she delivers and the kittens are old enough to go for adoption.

556,Why do Indian moms set their sons up for failure?,"What if their daughter in law died or got disabled - how would their precious sons eat, drink or survive? 

It amazes me that men still get patted on the back for equal contribution at home or even doing the bare minimum in a *dual income household*. Feels like the bar really is the floor for Indian sons. 

I want to raise my own damn kids not parent your helpless poorly raised son. 
Stop coddling you boys making them other people's liability to deal with.

Edit:

1. To all the people bringing up stay at home wives, I hope you actually read that my post was talking about dual income households, specifically anticipating division of labour arguments, and yet MAJORITY of the arguments are exactly that (r/whoosh). 
Also being able to cook and clean at least occasionally is a skill everyone should posses. What if (gasp!) your maid needs a couple of days off? 

This should be irrelevant but since so many people have been asking me to earn instead or more, I'd like to share that I've been earning more than him last 4 years(which is very common these days) and only recently did we start earning the same since I took a break to look after my terminally ill parent. We now have the same salary, hours and workload. 

2. A lot of people have mentioned their friends(male) who moved away from homes are independent and do their own cooking and cleaning. That seems to be the point most people here lost focus of. Most Indian men who move away from their homes/MOMs are actually very capable, functional adults because they were able to move away from the influence of their moms who would otherwise only enable them. 

3. A lot of people have been asking why I chose to be in this relationship or saying it's a personal issue I'm venting on - this is absolutely not a personal or individual issue. We know this is very much the norm in India. We do have some good men though - who had responsible parents OR left their homes when they were young single adults and learned to manage their own lives. Wish there were more parents and men like them. 

And also kudos to all the moms who recognize this problem and are doing what's right by their sons.",524,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

557,"My father pays his employees Rs 12k per month, and expects me to make Rs 1 lakh per month","I am omitting some details to avoid getting identified. I am from a somewhat privileged family. My father owns a business. And I grew up in a very strict academic environment. I went to US for undergraduate education. After that, I was going to do masters immediately but then a position opened at a corporation in India so I’ve been working here since then. And I am also fed up of US so I don’t want to go back. 

Now here’s the problem— everyone in my family is highly educated (they’re a doctors— have at least 4 degrees each) and they aspire me to have similar level of qualifications. He is somewhat disappointed that he spent a fortune on my undergrad education (a US bachelors degree costs at least Rs 1 crore) and I’m not making that much money (I started at Rs 24k and after 2.5 years experience, now I’m making Rs 44k). He is forcing/pushing me to do Masters degree (preferably in US) in the hopes that once I complete it, I can make a “decent” salary of Rs 1-2 lakh. I don’t see the value in spending another Rs 40 lakh if I’m not going to settle down there. And another thing thing is, I work in IT which is very different from medical field. In medicine, qualifications are highly valued (you have to be a specialist to perform surgeries) but in IT companies generally don’t care— as a fresher you are just to cheap resource for them and they are just concerned with what output you are giving (those fancy Rs 20 lakh or Rs 30 lakh packages are not as common as you think).  This is they hypocrisy that I am trying to communicate— at one point, you are regretting sending me to the US because of how expensive it was, then again you are forcing me to get another expensive-ass degree because “apan higher qualification ghyaycha asta” (“we should aspire to get the highest possible qualifications”). On a side note, he is doing his usual business stuff (we recently purchased 2 flats in the same building for me and my brother, and another 2 for expansion of our business) so we are not poor by any means.  And just day before yesterday, I found out that one of the guys in my fathers office who has been with us since many years makes a salary of Rs 12k (he is 40 years old— I don’t know how he is surviving in a place like Mumbai). And this is a guy who plays a major role in our tendering business (he is not some peon or sweeper/cleaner). And I am 26 and I already make 4 times what he makes but that is still not good enough apparently. This is another hypocrisy— you pay your employees peanuts and you expect other’s employers to pay their employees (me) some fat salaries. 

Just to clarify, my father is not elitist/classist or anything. He came from poverty and worked very hard (he is basically an overachiever and expects the same from me). And it seems that he has gotten so rich that he is completely out of touch with ground level reality of the common man. We had some annoying conversations about this and I even suggested a couple of times, that if we are so goddamn rich then why don’t you just let me work in or handle your business, but he replied “Te tujhya buddhi cha kaam nahi ahey” meaning “It’s not the kind of job you should do, you are smarter than that and you should do white-collar job”. Any comments/ advice from you guys will be helpful.

Edit—

Thank you for all the feedback. No my father is not abusive— it’s not the money part that he is insisting on. It’s just he wants me to be very very successful and it sometimes becomes overwhelming.",1574,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

I'm not gay but i feel bad for the people who are, for what they're going through - homophobia, insults, you name it. It's not just limited to the school, their behavior towards homosexual people reflects in every single aspect of life.

561,What does it mean to be proud of India when you had no choice in which country you were born?,"What does it mean to be a patriot or a proud nationalist when we are Indians because of an accident of birth? Someone who is proud of his caste, gender, religion is thought of as an insecure chauvinist whose self identity depends on looking down on others. Why then is being a patriot held up as a noble ideal?

Does being a proud Indian mean holding India superior to other countries? On what basis are we supposed to do that when people still die of starvation, when the country has one of highest rates of inequality in the world, when people kill their own children for marrying out of caste/faith, where children beg for food on the streets, where it is difficult for a girl to be married out without substantial dowry, where there is a system of graded inequality that decides your worth as a human being based on the family you are born in, and where we massacred tens of thousands of people for being born in a different faith.  I am not saying India is a bad place to be in, especially when you are an upper caste male like me, but it has its shortcomings and deficiencies just like other developing nations. As a patriot am I supposed to close my eyes to these problems and claim India as the greatest? Am I to support those who arrest and beat people for not standing up to the national anthem, am I to hate people who won't chant 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' on command, am I to demand harsh punishment for those who dare to support the opposing team in a sports contest with India?

Or does being a patriot mean that I should try to make the country a better place?  In that case isn't it our responsibility as humans to help anyone who needs it, no matter what country or creed they belong to? On what basis are we supposed to direct our resources and efforts only to assist those who were born within the confines of the same international border? A Punjabi in India has more in common with a Punjabi in Pakistan than with a Bengali, a Tamil has more in common with a Tamil in Sri Lanka than with a Delhiite. Does loving your country mean that we break our bonds of kinship with the rest of humanity to care only for those who have the same passport as us?

How are we supposed to hold a geo-political entity in the highest esteem when its borders were decided by the arbitrariness of the colonizer?  India's borders have never been inviolable - land swap agreements were entered into with Bangladesh, and chunks of land were lost in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh to China without anyone raising much of a fuss. A hundred years ago India was part of the British empire. India a hundred years from now won't have the same borders.

In 2016, a 14 year old girl and her 20 year old cousin in Haryana were gangraped for having allegedly consumed beef. Their uncle and aunt were tied up and beaten to death. While being raped, the 14 year old child was told that she had no place in India and should be in Pakistan. Is this girl supposed to remain a proud Indian and stand up every time the national anthem is played? Would hating India and Indians make her an anti-national traitor who deserves to be in prison? Should she continue to profess her love for India and be willing to sacrifice all that she has for her country while those around her ask her to go to Pakistan?

562,Its so easy to get acid in India.....,"Edit: No I'm not talking about drugs, I didn't know ""acid"" is a reference to LSD sorry for the confusion. I am referring to Hydrochloric acid and other stuff like that.

Ok so a bit of a context,

Our sink got choked up and it was leaking water everywhere so I (15M) had to go get some drain cleaner from the hardware store.I went there and asked for the Cleaner and some metal wire as Dad had asked for that stuff aswell. But ig the shopkepper didn't understand what I wanted so I had to explain the whole scene to him.Then he goes ""Apko 100ml ki acid bhi de du?"" I was like so weirded out by that but I said show me cause I wanted to know if he would give it to me. AND HE DID!! but then i didnt buy it ofc and went home.

so Basically a 15 yo can easily get some acid around here. Even after the acid attacks they are sold like something which is harmless.",1560,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

563,My Parents make terrible financial decisions and its affecting my future and mental health.,"My mom runs a business that has been seeing no sales ever since the pandemic struck us, she has many loans and my dad has loans of his own,you can see about 12 lakhs in total. I am 24 and recently got a job as a software engineer and pay their insurance, milk bill, house rent and lend them money. I earn 27k per month, I am trying to save up money for my Masters abroad but I keep taking money out of my savings to help them out with their loans. My mother keeps taking new loans to repay the older ones and she tells me all of it now suddenly, I wasn't aware of any of these. She keeps giving money to my brother in law and he never returns her money but she still gives him for my sisters well being. My dad only passed 12th and earns less than 30k per month and he has 10 lakhs outstanding from a past failed business. I am really worried about their future, I don't know if I can selfishly leave them here in India with their lack of financial acumen. I don't expect them to pay for my studies as I am planning on financing myself with my own savings and a small Student loan. I just don't understand what to do? Do I ask my mom to close down her business? Do I just leave them alone and move out? I can't take this stress anymore. I am seen as a stoic kid who doesn't get worried and helps his parents out but this shit keeps me up at night.

565,A short story about what happened recently,"I've seen multiple posts on here and in r/delhi about people feeling lonely or think their life sucks.

Here's a little bit about my life and what happened recently.

My elder brother got married in 2017, left us within a year as his wife couldn't adjust here. I tried to make things right in 2019 and for a while things became better. My mother was diagnosed with Lungs fibrosis and my father already had eye complications due to a botched surgery.

I asked him to come back but he refused saying his daughter won't be able to live without her naani (yes my brother is a ghar-jamai [stays with his in laws]).

We reluctantly shifted to where he stays in the same tower just two floors below. After settling down I saw the same pattern. He won't come to check up on mom-dad till Sunday night and that too for an hour. Luckily I had work from home so was able to take care of most of everything (cooking, washing etc.) as my mothers health kept deteriorating. I also could see she has started to develop early signs of Alzheimer's.

My bhabhi did help us out and my parents started liking her as well. But i don't know what triggered her (maybe my best friend who hung out with me quite often) but she suddenly stopped coming altogether. 

Me and my brother had a fight last year in April and he categorically told me not to come near his daughter as I don't deserve her. That did hurt me as I loved her.

My parents could also see his and his wife's behaviour and my father asked me to help sell him his property and buy a new one elsewhere. It was a property bought by my parents from their savings so they didn't feel the need to consult my brother. They said when he himself wants to distance himself from us then we are not at liberty to discuss what we want to do with our asset. I helped them and we sold off that property and I transferred the funds to my parents account, keeping nothing with me. 

Quite soon word got out, my relatives informed my bhabhi and surely she called me and asked me to stay away from her daughter forever as I've taken the property leaving nothing for them. She never asked why I did what I did, just laid these dictats to me. I didn't say anything to her and now it's been 2 months and despite living in the same building just two floors apart, my brother can't be bothered to visit his own parents , one of whom can't see much and my mother who has Stage 3 Alzheimer's and Lungs Fibrosis.

Not all is doom and gloom, I've got a pretty nice job at a Reputed News Organization and I know that I'll have to support my parents as they've always supported me.

So for anyone who things their life sucks because of a job or a bad relationship or lack of one or whatever know this that yes life is hard, but to quote a famous person ""it's not about how hard you can hit but how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.""

So anyone feeling low, just keep moving forward.

Edit : Thank you guys for your wishes for my parents. One thing I've seen is that many are blaming my SIL for what happened. No point in doing that. Jab apna sikka khota ho to dusro ko kya bolna.

My brother had been distant from us since 2005 when he landed a job in another metro. Even when he came back he was aloof and hardly was an active member of the house. And he did real fucked up shit which eroded much of my respect and love for him. So whatever happened, although his MIL is a lot to be blamed, is mainly on him and how he behaved and continues to do so.",511,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

566,To all those thinking of immigrating to Canada,"Don't! Don't waste your time! This country is a giant winter wasteland with WAY LESS economic opportunity than India, massively passive-aggressive people and stupidly high costs of living.

Edit - I was just upset after having a bad experience (which, in retrospect, was my fault) and just wanted a place to vent - so don't take my anger too seriously. I've been in Canada for 3+ years and have had both good and bad experiences, but mainly good. The last 2 years in the country haven't been as good due to continuous lockdowns, growing costs and a more challenging job market but am optimistic in the country's future. I've spoken to many people here from different backgrounds and do realise Canada is heaven for some people and the country does an incredible job at welcoming those people. Otherwise, I say, figure out what you want, do your own research, and make a decision.

Edit 2 - I should not have made such an overarching claim for the entire country (studying and building a career here alone without family support can be quite challenging and stressful at times)

Edit 3 - regarding passive-aggression, that's just the communication style here (it can be challenging to navigate at first, but you get a hang of it soon)",207,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

569,Women in Indian marriages,"It makes me sad to see the state of women in Indian marriages. Our generation grew up watching the tired women wait in the kitchen while the males discuss politics and eat together on the dining table. They were expected to clean up, be responsible and be submissive. 

But it's even sadder to see in our own generation. My own sister (29F), after (arranged) marriage is a completely different person. Her life revolves around pleasing her husband and in-laws. By BIL (32M) puts in barely half the amount of effort as she does. From social gatherings, to household responsibilities, it's always her taking the burden on herself. She's a working woman who is expected to take days off of work to babysit her sister-in-law's kids when she's ""too tired"" to take care of her own kids. She massages the feet of her FIL and MIL every night. 

She has completely changed her wardrobe and now only wears clothes that her mother-in-law finds appropriate. 

She is expected to pay a portion of her salary to her mother-in-law every month (as a gift) and she does! She says she doesn't want to but can't help it otherwise it'll create arguments with her husband. 

And before you ask, no, he isn't physically or mentally abusive. He just doesn't care. She calls him ""chill"" because he doesn't want to get into ""women's arguments"". 

I think it's pathetic. My parents have tried to intervene but they stop when she says that these arguments will ruin her marriage. 

She's never been in any relationship and this is the first time she has experienced romantic love. She's too scared to mess it up, but she has dissolved her own self-esteem and dignity.

572,Public PDA,"I am in the food court of a local mall. It's lunch hour, and mostly office goers, sales people and college kids are roaming around. In one corner there is a couple (maybe in college) and they are cuddling each other and kissing.

There is a gujarati lady who is sitting in one of the tables with her male colleague. And she keeps staring at them. This lady is young, maybe no more than 28-30 years old. And she starts complaining to the cleaning staff about it.

""Tell them to take it somewhere else. This is a place where respectable people come...""etc.

She was looking around to see if she could get any support. I politely asked her to mind her own business.

Probably being naive here - but it bothers me that, a young person like her wants to do moral policing. Is it patriarchy or some sort of ingrained inferiority complex that makes them to act out and infringe on others actions.

575,"""Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah"" is unfunny, tone-deaf, regressive yet wildly popular!","Just checked that the show has over 3,300 episodes currently; and there seems to be no signs of slowing down.

The plots are beyond wafer-thin; the same scene is shown at least twice (once before the ad break & then right after) in the name of ""continuity"" - which means that the actual content has a LOT of fillers.

The sound effects are shoved in 18 to the Dozen because what is nuance anyway? How else will be understand the **SUBTLE** jokes and know our cue to laugh...

Not to mention, jokes about weight; appearances, finances, all sorts of low hanging community jokes. 

Dr. Hathi gets some of the worst material directed at him; so does his son; Sodhi is the punchline for most typical Sardar jokes; Iyer gets the dark skinned / unattractive person taunts; and also the *idli dosa* / South Indian fare of jokes.

earlier there were some random episodes where the underlying theme was at least noble - raising awareness against online scams was a good one i know of - but the approach to everything is ridiculously binary; and in most cases - one-dimensional. 

all scenarios are too utopian & rather elegantly ideal; there's almost no consequences; and the lack of diversity is worse than in the saccharine drenched Barjatiya movies. 

Prayer helps solve problems - but not actual planning or strategy. 

There are so many problematic ""jokes"" in every scene of every episode; not to mention the incredibly dumbed down & patronizing manner of handling every self generated problem that the characters face.

And the episodes with any famous person are just so bare; with cringe inducing celebrity worship.

Wonder when the makers will try to step up from their regressive, juvenile plots & scripts.

576,How do you deal with an angry and sensitive wife?,"Hello fellow redditors,

 My wife gets angry even for the slightest things and spews out harsh words. I understand that anger is just a feeling, I believe it matters how you express it. The other day she asked me to soak some rice for cooking and I soaked the wrong type of rice. She shouted like 15 mins saying that I don’t even have common sense ( I did look at the correct rice type but while taking it out, took it out from the wrong bag). There was an argument once and I shouted back at her also. The next day my neighbour complained to keep our voice down. So whenever we have an argument and she shouts I will ask her to keep the volume. She would then say that I’m living my life just to please others. She always fights in front of others in public places. I ask her to go home and talk and she wouldn’t listen to me. I have done a monstrous thing of hitting her on 2 separate occasions since I lost my patience (which is one of the worst things I have ever done in my life)

She always things in the wrong angle as well. One day I ate lunch at my mother-in-law’s place. I got food poison that day. I just said to the wrong that I got food poison after eating lunch. For that, she said you are accusing my mother. I did not mean to ill speak of my mother-in-law. So most of the time I keep quiet knowing that if I speak I might hurt her with my words. For that also she tells me I’m a non-expressive person. I know these are all common issues but I’m fed up with someone shouting at me all the time. I got married quite late (at 31) and I have been single until then. So I’m not used to these sorts of things. I feel like sometimes I should go back to being single

Sorry for ranting by I feel like I have no one else to vent out my frustration. Whenever I tell someone and she comes to know, she will it make even a bigger issue. Any advice/ideas/thoughts are much appreciated",51,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

577,The number of Indians with undiagnosed mental illness must be very high.,"My childhood was full of verbal, emotional, physical abuse. Although my 20s were pretty okayish, my mental health went into a tailspin and I haven't recovered since. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and considering my behavior I also may have BPD or CPTSD.

In my 20s, I used to think that majority of people are perfect and I let that assumption alienate myself. But nope. Many people are as broken as me or more than me. Considering the toxic behavior that is rampant at organizations is itself a major indicator of mental health issues. Also, many of our parents had their fair share of problems so they were extremely incompetent at raising us.

The toxic behavior at organizations itself shows that most people were stripped off of their self-esteem in childhood and they don't know how to treat others or get work done. I cant even get started on empathy and other aspects.

All in all, I think it's a pest. Pigeon poop can be a cause of respiratory diseases too and in general, the corners they stay in tend to be extremely dirty and unhygienic.

The reason why pigeon population has swelled is because people feed them grains. In most cities, there are corners near roads where pigeon feeding is done.

Please just consider this a rant.

She wakes up at 9 and hits the laptop straight without even brushing or whatever. Her workplace is very flexible with work timings. Most people log in at 9:30-10. Doesn't even have any food or whatever. Doesn't shower properly and after daily meetings finally sits down to eat her FIRST meal of the day at 12. Fucking 12. She'll work like this till fucking 10 or later. And guess what, there's not even that much work according to her. She just burns out and wastes one two hours in the middle. Sleep at god knows what time. Rinse and repeat. What about the weekend then? Oversleep and compensate by hibernating like a bear.

Obviously this has consequences. She's now suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome and severe back pain along with occasional bouts of fever/fatigue. Take care of your health guys.

I respect them a lot but please respect my personal space. How can I make them understand this or am I the only one facing this? This is really fucking up my mental peace. I'm not even able to go out somewhere from past 1.5 years due to covid, I missed so many trips because I don't want to beg them for permission everytime. Now I don't even plan anything due to this.





**EDIT** : I really appreciate all the comments and suggestions from fellow redditors. Just wanted to clarify few things in case I missed that earlier, I'm very much capable to moving out, I'm earning a very good money. It's just that I don't want to lie to them like my office is opened and I have to move out. My conscience feels very bad about it. Even if I do that, I feel like I won't be able to lie for too long. Indian parents feel betrayed when their child ask to move out without any reason. And I'm not gonna marry just because of this so early in my life😂

About the other things, I'm living at home at 25, because of covid situation, Ive been living away from past 5 years for my studies and work, this is the first time I've been at home in such a long time. 

Also, I'm just here to rant, I welcome all the suggestions and opinions with open arm. I can see a lot of people have faced the similar issues earlier in their life and were able to mitigate them and a lot of them still facing the same and somehow able to ignore them. Kudos to you guys for resolving the issues without harming your relations. Few years back, I was able to make them comfortable with me not being a  strongly religious person, they've now stop pestering about that. May be I can do the same here. I'll try to work on that and hopefully able to resolve them, before it's too late.

Thanks for all the kind gesture random strangers ☺️",125,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

592,I do not want to lose my brother in the hands of patriarchy and toxic parents.,"Hi,
It is around 4 am and I have no idea what else to do.
Here is what happened with my brother and me(F) today!
Before anything I want to clarify my father is not in the picture.
My mother is 51 years old and is having health issues from last few years.
My brother has to take her to the hospital every other day, to take care of her.
 (I am currently pursuing a professional degree that is why I am not able to do much since few months)
I have taken care of her too.
Here, we do everything for her, take her to doctor, she doesn't take her medicine on time never eats on time and she has cholesterol problem but won't change her eating habbits, she has gained weight and facing knee pain issue but is not doing anything to solve it - anything.
She keeps on complaining about her pain mostly to my brother and once he asked her, ""what do you want me to do? Shall I give you my knees??"" And my mother asked him ""is it possible??""
Also everyone in the family keeps coming and telling my brother do this, do that so mummy will be better , but it is not in my brother's hands, if my mother is not taking any responsibility for her own health.
(We can keep cook too, but she won't let us because she has to see if work is done properly or not)
He (my brother) is just 21 and last few years most of his time is gone in the hospitals.
And after doing all of these things my mother tells us we don't do anything for her, we treat her badly.
Also my brother was trying to tell her that it is not true and she threw a fit, she started crying at 2 in night and called all the neighbours!!
After all this my brother is not able to handle this, he has lost all hopes from life, doesn't enjoy anything, can't sleep peacefully, is not able to study, he is talking about suicide. (He is just 21)
I have endured all this but I have learned to ignore, he told me he has to live with her (mother) he doesn't want to.
We just stopped crying.
I have never seen my brother like this.
I have no idea what to do!!
The patriarchal society is treating men so badly I do not know what to do.
My brother told me he can't remember his favourite movies or password which he used to remember, he is losing his sanity.
My mother is really a psycho and in India where parents are considered god, and mental health is a taboo topic, I do not have any idea what to do now!
I won't let anything happen to my brother, he has his whole life infront of him.

We can't talk about this to our friends because no one is going to understand how is it to live with a parent who is toxic and psycho.

Please help how to overcome days (phase) like these.",274,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

595,Stupidity of parents,"OK so this might be a bit long but bear with me

&#x200B;

so I'm 14M, and me and my family recently went to Goa for a vacation, and the entire time we were there, I was the only one wearing my mask.

&#x200B;

cuz every other second my parents were like 

""oh we have to swim, we cant wear our masks""

""oh we're having breakfast""  
""look we gotta take good photos to send to friends and family ok""

&#x200B;

and now as we came back I told them to get tested, as we roamed in goa for like a week.

and then my mom, who is a dentist, is like

""We're not showing symptoms, we dont need to test ourselves 

&#x200B;

and since i read about diseases in biology, we learnt about incubation periods, and while u aren't showing symptoms, u can still spread the virus

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

fast forward to day before yesterday, my dad started showing symptoms 

yet he was not ready to isolate himself

which he did eventually, as the symptoms got worse

&#x200B;

and then they finally agreed to testing for covid, which came positive today, and I'm showing mild symptoms as well

&#x200B;

and here i am, who told them to get tested weeks ago, and my mom is like

""It could not have been prevented"" ""I'm a doctor"" ""I know better than you,""  
""Dont try to be over smart""

&#x200B;

like i fail to understand this behavior from my mother, who is, ironically, a doctor 

&#x200B;

also interestingly, today is exactly 14 days after our vacation, which just so happens to be the incubation period of covid.",663,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

597,Shyness fuc* up my chance,"What the hell is wrong with me. Yesterday I was in metro going from Palam to Janakpuri West (Delhi) when I saw a trio (a guy and two girls) in the same metro. One of the girl who was wearing a denim outfit was checking me out and I saw her and then I checked her out and had an eye contact and I smiled (but fuc* covid she couldn't notice because of the mask). Then both the girls started looking at me and talking and giggling in a good way. We all departed the metro at Janakpuri West and then I went to the escalators and suddenly the girl with denim outfit came right next to me (on the same step) and said to the other girl ""I knew this would happen"" (I was on the escalators first, she came next to me). I saw a  opportunity and had calculated every thing in my mind like how I am gonna go to them and talk to her (will let her know she was looking cute, {I mean it}) and the would ask for insta/snap/number but because of being virgin as fuc* and never had a good female interaction and shy ofcourse, I never gathered enough confidence to go to her and ask her out. Now we were entering metro towards Rajouri Garden but we entered from different gates, you would ask why? (Well I have been living in Delhi since birth and yet I don't know which metro is going where) I got confused with the metro and went there late. And then both the girls departed in between Janakpuri West and Rajouri Garden. While leaving the metro and going towards the stairs I saw her again looking at me with a little smile as I could felt the positive vibes. But then the door closed.

And that's how I fucke* up...

(What I learnt?
You could be frank and ask instead of ignoring and later regretting about the situation)

598,Ragging is no more ? or is it ?,"So my college is about to begin in person classes and just today the whatsapp group was flooded with lots of messages regarding some apparent rules set by assh\*les in 2nd,3rd and 4th year. (You'll see in a moment why I called them that) that we'd have to ""follow"" or else ""you know what they will do"". I asked that guy we made CR of our class and he said ""you will know what they will do once you come to the campus"".

My college does have an anti-ragging cell. And I know the contact of the teacher in charge of that, what should I do ?

These rules btw, come in light of recent events : A guy from (1st year) some other department got drunk in front of the seniors and was like about to jump from the terrace. so now they are doing such stupid things to all the students of 1st year ?

Their f\*cking dress code includes : no open neck t-shirts. I am a male and this is for boys. Like wtf do they have with open neck t shirts ? almost all my clothes are open neck. Also who the fuck are these assholes to decided what I wear or not wear ?

Also they want us to remember the names of all the senior CRs for some reason ? like why ? this is top level narcissism and the kids must be really f\*cked up in their head.

Does this qualify as ragging ? FUCK THESE ASSHOLES

599,Discriminatory Nature of Indian Students in Germany,"Preface:

I (27M) have been studying in Germany for the past 3 years now, and there are some general observations that really bother me. I don't know what I plan to achieve by posting it over here. Most likely to get it out of my chest, and this is the only space on the internet where someone would get it.

Every Indian in my university is part of a group that contains people from their own state. There is a Kannada group (the most prevalent one, but this changes based on which city of Germany you go to), a Marathi group, a Tamil group etc. etc. The students of one group only socialize with those of their own state. This especially extends to days such as Diwali or Navratri. Due to my personal background, I don't really fit into any one group, which doesn't bother me, but my girlfriend who usually enjoys these celebrations, is also deliberately excluded by those who speak her language as they don't want to invite a South Indian to their party. Even within these groups, the people differentiate based on caste, vegetarians/no-vegetarians etc. You get the idea. It would be still ignorable if it ended here, but it's usually not the case. I had the misfortune of attending 3-4 parties, and it almost always boils down to a drunken rant about how North/South Indians are assholes, depending on the host. Beating the same dead horse of idli-dosa and Rajnikant-worshipping from the North side, and illiterate cow-worshippers from the other team.

Secondly, the case of overt racism. Now racism does not have to always be white-on-brown. It can be the other way around, as my lovely colleagues here have demonstrated. The Indians pretty much exclusively work with each other. Now this is usually not a problem since my course is like 90% Indians, but for modules outside our department, you have people from all over the world. So if you have a team of two Indians and one other guy, they end up speaking in Hindi with each other the whole time, even during the meetings which leads to really awkward scenarios. And they routinely trash-talk the Germans in Hindi in front of them. It's true that they won't understand the words, but mate everyone knows when the topic of conversation in the room is about them. 

And my final gripe, is the stubborn refusal to learn the language and have the audacity to call the locals unwelcoming. Sure, every place has a few assholes, but in my 3 years here I have found that if they see you making an effort to speak German, they are more than willing to talk slowly and use all the English at their disposal as well. And by make an effort I don't mean learning the A2 vocabulary list by heart and bringing the ""language certificate"" from some obscure pay-to-win school next to your house. 

&#x200B;

Well that's the end of my rant. If there are any armchair humanities experts you could elaborate on this. Or better if any of my colleagues are redditors maybe you can defend your case eh? Have a nice day and stay safe.",109,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

601,A weird conversation with an old man probably led me to lose focus on my riding and I fell while parking,"I'm going through some personal problems and little bit depression.

So I often go for practice motorcycle riding on little to no traffic roads and dirt streets and spending time in uncrowded places like near a small canal or fields.

And it does help. **I'm learning riding at a late age** and I have a good time when I sit alone.

**Here's a weird (at least I felt uncomfortable with him) conversation happened:**

A 60+ year old aged man stopped and told me you look mentally upset because I'm noticing you for 4 days and you daily come here and sit alone.

I said yes I might look different from others at the moment because I've lost my job and I come here to learn riding and spending some time as it helps me feel better. Further it's the best time for me to learn riding as I might not get a chance again.

I lost one of my family member some years ago that has also some impact on my personal life. I didn't tell him because then he would go into details. But that's not why I go there so I didn't tell him. **He was just curious rather than having a genuine conversation.**

Then he started politics. Discussed some privatization of businesses. Then he asked where do I live, what does my parents do, what is your father's name. Are you married or not (I'm not married so far).

The he said you're jobless but it's fortunate **your father has a govt. job so you don't need to worry.** I felt embarrassed and I didn't know how to reply.

**Lastly, he said what's your caste?** Again I told him caste but I felt very embarrassed.

I kept telling him all what he asked but he was reluctant telling about himself. **He was just curious.**

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After that he left. **And I decided to go home ASAP** **because I had lost my focus.**

I stopped in the way just to adjust a few things like helmet. I forgot to pull the side stand down to park and I lost balance and I fell down in dirt. It happened first time.

It was good that there was no injury or damage. It is a small road with no other vehicles.

It may sound like an obvious mistake - and obviously it was my silly mistake but I still feel it all happened because I had lost some attention and focus. I was thinking about the conversation all the time before it happened.

But I feel if I hadn't done that conversation with that man, I wouldn't decide to return home and would pay more attention while parking the bike like I always do.",82,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

602,What's with more and more people making zero effort to converse in the regional language of a state or English?,"I don't know if this is just my experience, but I'm from Chennai, and recently (more than ever), there has been a huge influx in the number of people in the customer service sector, restaurants or general calls making no effort to converse in English or in Tamil.
***
I don't particularly expect them to speak in perfect English or Tamil, even broken English/Tamil works! Honestly, I'm even fine with them speaking in Hindi, as I'm quite fluent in Hindi myself, if, and *only* if they request if they can speak in Hindi during the course of the call at the beginning. That's basic manners. Literally no one goes ""Sir/Ma'am, would it be alright if we converse in Hindi?"", and instead they just start rambling on in Hindi. This is incredibly annoying. 

I've had this happening to me while talking to people from food delivery services, customer service, taxis, telemarketing calls, or even calls from the bank sometimes. What's going to hurt if people just politely say they aren't comfortable in English/Tamil and request to continue in Hindi? They're **very well** aware that a call is being made to someone who lives in Tamil Nadu. It has *TAMIL* in the goddamn name. How dense do people have to be to not understand this? 

You might ask why I have a problem if I'm fluent in Hindi. Look, like some other Tamilians, growing up, my 2nd language was Hindi when I was living here. That *still* doesn't excuse the fact that they're calling a state where the majority speaks Tamil and they're blathering on about something in another language. *Please* make the effort to request if we're comfortable in another language. There are a majority of people here who do not understand Hindi to keep up with whatever they're speaking.

Has this happened to you too? I'm *this* close to not losing my cool on a call. 

Also - I'm not sure if such rants have been posted in the past since I'm not active in country-specific subreddits - I just had to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading and have a good day :)",165,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

608,I made a mistake. I hope you won't.,"(Edit: added TLDR) I've never posted here before but today is different, because today I feel like what I have done needs to be reflected on and maybe in the process of reflecting on my actions, others can avoid making the same mistake. So here it goes.

I went out for a ride today, seeing as it had been a long time since I've been cooped up in my room. The weather was nice and I wanted to catch the sunset from a good viewpoint. So I decided to ride out to some nearby hills.

The road/highway that leads to this place is pretty straight and as you travel out from the city's hub, the traffic decreases, which makes riding faster possible and fun. So I get to this viewpoint located on the hills, next to the ghat road and click a few pics and start to leave.

The road is just a single lane ghat road with a few bumps here and there and overtaking can get troublesome because of long chains of buses and so forth. So as I'm riding along, this guy with a woman behind him cuts me off while trying to overtake me pretty fast. I was going fast enough as it was so it kinda pissed me off and I wanted to give him a piece of my mind, so I started upping my pace too.

The guy knew I was trying to catch up with him so he accelerated further and tried to get further ahead. At this point we were both riding within the limits of what the traffic would allow, nothing too dangerous. However as we reached the base of the hill, I saw the opportunity to catch up to him. 

So I gun the throttle like a juvenile and overtake the guy while trying to stay within the right lane. The trouble is, I was going too fast on the corner and I didn't lean into the turn as much as I should have because I was scared of the wheels slipping, I was on a scooter and not my bike. 

As you could expect, I ran wide and there was a scooter straight ahead on the edge of the road. I was going too fast to come to a halt. The land next to the road was basically a ditch or a lowered bump with lots of rocks. In a split second i aimed for the gap between the edge of the road and the scooter and in doing so, went half into the ditch. My scooter jumped hard and the front wiggled twice but it was over, I had somehow not crashed.

Then the shame hit. That moment was easily the stupidest in my life and I knew it the second after it had happened. I risked the lives of others on the road for the pettiest of things and almost risked death doing it. 

The journey home was a ride of shame. I kept thinking about that moment and how stupid I had been to let such a thing happen. You see I had expected to have my first close brush with death on the road through the hands of some other. All those times I cursed out at people speeding confidently in the wrong side, it just feels negated. It feels like I shouldn't get a say in correcting others anymore because I'm just as bad if not worse than all the  idiots I've encountered.

Now all I can do is sit here and think about this event and every time I'll go out on a ride, I'll be reminded of what I did and I'll start to feel ashamed. What I did has tainted my genuine passion of riding and my guilt will serve me and others well, because I will not be able to twist the throttle for 'fun' with my conscience.

Please don't make the same mistake as me, is all I can say to conclude the post. If you have had something like this happen to you, what happened and how did you overcome the shame and fear? How do you stay responsible on the road as much as is humanly possible? It would be helpful to hear your answers.

TLDR:
I was cut off by a guy and pushed my limits to catch up to him for confrontation. Almost crashed into traffic but made it out with the slimmest of luck. Now I feel extremely ashamed of myself and don't feel like I deserve to be on the road with what I did, it has ruined my taste for riding. I hope you don't make the same mistake and any suggestions would be helpful.",129,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

609,My fiancé told me the truth and it broke me.,"throwaway for obv reasons.

I(28M) is engaged to my fiancé (27F) 2 months back. We have known each other for 6 months. It is an arranged marriage. Yesterday, at our date, she happened to told me here past. We were discussing things and casually talking when this topic arrived and  I think it slipped from her and  it was not her intension to tell me.

She told me that she had a single partner which I knew. She told me at the very start she was in a relationship which did not last long(not judging and fine by me) and she was single for 5 years. However, yesterday I got to know that she had 3 bf all last for not more than an year. Added to this, she had a lot of hookups and bear with me and apparent threesome with her office partners (not bf). She told me that she was wild and liked to do these things as it bring thrill an excitement. This was not which broke me, it was her next sentence and I quote, ""I was wild and wanted to experience fun and thrill as much when I was young, now that I am getting old, I want a simple guy who had good finances and can take care of my needs (in short her bills), and then I found you.""

Fuck. Shit. At that time, I laughed it and dismiss it, but now that I think of it, its true. She did expected me to take her to expensive restaurants and shit. I feel like I have been used. Its like, she never loved me neither she plans on doing that, rather she is with me just because I am fairly rich. Its like I am her backup plan and a bank which pays her luxury. Also, I am having a strong feeling that she is gonna cheat me if I marry her. How did it come to this, I was against arrange marriage, due to this exact reason. Fuck, I am having a panic attack rn. I know many of you will say don't judge her for her past, but goddamn it the past does not go away and disappear. 

Its like women enjoys her youth and settles for a good guy when they grow old, while young men suffer, struggle and work hard to get on their own feet. Its so fucking unfair. All women wants is a rich man or bf. But a young guy is only rich if his parents are rich. Not like me who had worked hard to get all this wealth sacrificing the prime years. Men are not loved unconditionally. We have value only if we are rich or have a stable job. But for women, they are loved no matter there are rich or poor. Even ugly girls get too much attentions. I know these are toxic thoughts but there is some truth to that or maybe I am an asshole or its the panic talking. I have been cheated before when I had a gf in college, same thing, she cheated me with a rich bf. After which my years were literal hell. All I wanted was to be feel loved and cared for. I don't think I will get that, not in this lifetime. What should I do.?",29,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

611,Shark Tank India problem.,"Started watching it recently and must say it is addictive. I love the format and also the ideas presented. But one thing I dislike the most is the hypocrisy shown by some sharks. 

1. Ashneer- His company is running in losses. If we keep aside the fictional hyper inflated valuations, Bharatpe is clear cut a loss making business with no future. But still he has the audacity to ask for Gross Profit Margin and Net Profit margins of businesses. Also 2 amazing statements by this man (he takes pride in saying these)
 ""Ye tech hiring ki industry maine bigadi hai. Quarter ka 50 lakh ka kharcha toh mera techies ko BMW bikes dene mein jaata hai."" 
Slow claps.
""20,000 crore ki company hai meri. Din ka 20 crore ka dhandha (he said dhandha and realized fuck ye nahi bolna tha) VALUE banata hu.""
Slow claps 2. 
Actually it is not only with ashneer but 1000s of startups mainly tech are following this cult of heavy valuations by showing an idea which even they don't know would work or not. 
The biggest asshole and snobby bastard of this industry is Kunal Shah. Considers himself Sadguru of Tech Startups, man has baalti bhar gyan on every topic and his full time job is to vomit his ideas on linkedin and twitter. [Check his reply when a reporter asked him about Cred's profitability issue. ](https://youtu.be/PdolxU78Cv8)

2. Namita- Correct me if I am wrong but Namita is Exe Director of Emcure, which is a company founded by her father so ideally toh Namita ke papa ko wo khursi pe baithna chaiye. Ugh. ""Namita mai ye aapke shark hone ke idea se relate nahi kar paa raha isiliye I am out in liking you.""

3. Ghazal- Don't get me started on Mama earth and this lady. Ye puri brand sirf ek hi chiz se chali hai funding uthao, youtubers/instagrammers ko bank transfer karo. No genuine product bas paisa thoos ke they are force feeding us to see this brand everyday everywhere. Plus she is so fake. Atleast ashneer is what he is.

The thing I have noticed about these rich metropolitan people is that they are very VERY disconnected from the rest of the country. Like no idea how people are except what they read in their NCERT civics textbook or on their newsfeed. Also they have this weird superiority thing where they think they are better, smarter and more tasteful than everyone else in the country. And there their tastefulness and class shows particularly in how they flaunt their wealth, it's generally a copy paste of whatever trends they see in the US. Not to mention the forced accents, those really get on my nerve.

I have a hard time falling asleep on most days, I wouldn't be able to sleep on time and as a consequence I wouldn't be able to wake up on time. If someone is unable to sleep, what would he do? Either use his phone or get into overthinking loop, same happens with me and it gives me stress when I get into that overthinking zone. I would sleep at 12 today, tomorrow by 12 again but then won't be able to sleep by 3. I can't even explain how much damage this has done to me.

During school days, my mom would wake me up and make sure that I go to school everyday. I had like 95%+ attendance in school because she wouldn't let me stay at home unless am seriously ill.

During college, I was living in a hostel, I could never sleep and wake up consistently at the same time and couldn't go to college on time. I was short of attendance. I ended up dropping out of college (this wasn't the sole reason of dropping out, but this caused a lot of damage in my life because I couldn't even enjoy my college life since I was unable to go to college at time) My college was like from 8AM in the morning so more than half of the class had a hard time showing up at time because you need to wakeup atleast by 7AM to get ready and be in the class by 8.

617,Homophobia in India ( A review),"So I made a post talking about a recent incident in my life. See the original post for details. And I got a lot of comments and they were a mixed bag. So here is my observation. 

1. Many of you were supportive of me and gave me helpful advice. Some of you slid into my DMs for the same. Thanks. 
2. A minority of you were able to understand my BF's issue instead of calling him a jerk and being a jerk to him.
3. A lot of you were sympathizers for his partner. This is totally fair but most of these were acting that he is willfully doing it. Many of them identified him to be the problem rather than the society. (One of you was kind enough to make a post calling him(or people like him) an asshole). And that my dear friend is blatant ignorance you are imagining what you would have done (run away, Stay single(that is also a pain in the ass in the country, etc.) Without caring for the mental logistics or the things at stake. 

It is blaming the victim. In India with the exception of a few lucky ones barely do people get a say in their life. I am one of those lucky but coming out is still challenging so imagine it for people from a religious and conservative family like my bf. 

4. Many of you asked him to grow a spine. Which is desirable but it is easier said than done. His fear is rational and you know who isn't rational the society. So instead of wishing to star that he grows a spine, it is better to wish to star that people were rational. 

5. Many of you asked me to break up. But I am gonna try to help him and encourage him. It isn't morally correct for me to take an exit So I am gonna continue and hope for the best. 

6. And yeah there were some clear homophobes calling homosexuality a disgrace but they were a fringe minority. 

7. He ain't Bi.

My thoughts:-

 If people will deny the root cause of a problem and blame the victim things ain't improving. these things ain't happening cause such people are assholes as u/naveenpun thinks they are forced into it. Fighting for it is the ideal thing but not everyone is a fighter and those who are should help others fight not to call them things.

Also, Gay marriage in India is not a real marriage it is a pretend marriage with no legal basis for it no legal security. So legally we as a society have provided gay folks one option to be alone. How sad is that? but this was also not a thing raised by people who blamed people like my bf. No one of them was like ""as a solution we should legalize same-sex marriage and spread awareness"".

618,[Rant] So Managers can never be sick?,"I work in probably the most recognisable fast food joint and one of their policies is that we can not have medical leaves. I got covid positive late last month and was on a leave for more or less 15 days. I recovered and was fully fit within seven days but due to a ""company policy"" i need to show them a negative RTPCR report after 7 days of testing positive. I thought i had a common cold so initially i just took leaves till i fell better. Since my leaves were more than 3 days the HR wanted a covid test and i tested positive and they said they can't have me back on job before 7 day quarantine period (which is fine). 

Now, here's the fucked up part. Yesterday they told me to apply all my Casual leaves, paid leaves and even celebration leaves in order to get my full paycheck. I had no choice but to do it. They said they can't pay me for my days in quarantine period. Mind you this company recently became a large cap company. The only way to avail Medical leaves is through their affiliated hospital and i need to be hospitalized in order to avail them. 

I don't have any leaves left with me now so later this year i get sick, a family member gets sick, someone fucking dies and i can't get any leaves? It'll be leave without pay. I don't know how many of you will read this, how many of you will even recognise the company, all i want to do is spread awareness on how your favourite fast food companies treat their employees.

619,Indian parents believe that their children are their personal property,"Indian children have little freedom, personal space and room for independent thinking. Whether it be education, career, relationships or marriage, parents not only suggest but also dictate their children's life choices for them.

And I firmly believe that this is really problematic. Tomorrow, when you will not be there, will he/she be able to make good decisions independently? More importantly, will he/she feel happy and successful in the path of life you decided?

You have to understand that as parents your duty is to guide your children as they grow up. Take care of them and teach them to be good human beings. And very importantly, teach them to be able to make good choices in life. Yes, definitely guide them, and then trust your guidance to help them make their own decisions in life.

Don't burden your children with your dreams and ambitions. Don't live the life you couldn't have through them. Your children will do everything they can to make you happy. But let them know that your happiness is in their becoming good, capable and independent human beings who were taught to make good decisions in life.

I don't know. Maybe it's too difficult to let go. Maybe it's too difficult to accept what was once a part of you, now making choices different from what you wish for them.",156,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

620,"Please hear me out, I'll really appreciate.","I am a 21 year old female, currently in 3rd of my B.Tech degree in chemical engineering in a very popular college in Tamilnadu (Not SRM). I got 8.18 GPA in my first semester, I worked hard but somehow got this much only. From second semester i found engineering sort of really hard, that's when we were all called back home due to COVID. Gave the final exams of that semester online and scored 8.14 GPA. For the consecutive semesters, the subjects kept getting harder but in the name of cheating only wrote theory questions from either Teacher's uploaded PPT or whatever I could remotely found related in Google since it was open book, for the numerical part, i always did them myself.

But the students who were scoring 5 GPA in offline, started scored 8.5+ GPA in online and i could never understand why. 3rd semester - GPA - 8.13
It got so much worse in 4th semester, i got 7.82 GPA, despite getting 80+ marks in most subjects. Since the relative grading fucked so many things up.

Got depressed, took more credits than I can handle and with the help of Chegg for 1-2 subjects, scored 8.11 GPA in the 5th semester. (Still very less, got B grade in 91 marks)

I have done many other things In college, published one review article, worked on so many others, 2 of them might get published by the time I graduate, others just got abandoned. 
I earned some money in a management role internship. Did an offline internship last year and training in a lab of other college, learned a foreign Language.

This semester the subjects are the toughest and the college is going to reopen in the middle (next week). So I'll have to give rest of the exams offline. The minimum I can afford to score is 7.62 in order to keep my CGPA atleast 8.0.

I am planning to do my masters in an asian country like either China, Singapore, Japan etc. But my confidence is hanging by a thread. I work hard, pay attention in classes, do my assignments myself but still scoring Less. If you have any advice on as to how to land in a good University on masters, and what can I do to compensate for my GPA please comment.

622,"I have an advice for guys in college. Date while you are in college, I didn't do it and regret it now."," 

I'm 24 and had one of the worst gender ratio that you could imagine - 1:15, my friends from school who had 1:1 or 1:2 ratio laugh away and just don't believe me when I tell them this.

I'm a shy guy so all these tips that you find online like join gym or some kind of social activity where you can interact with women doesn't work for me. These may work for people who are already good at socializing.

I've some friends from school who were shy too but they had an excellent gender ratio in their college. They ended up befriending lot of women in college which helped them in dating.

I regret not dating in college, but at the same time I tell myself I didn't have girls around me so there's no way I could have dated, right? I'm introverted and shy so didn't volunteer in college fest. Some guys from my class found girls from other sections (or even senior/junior) from these fest and ended up dating these girls or their friends.

I thought I would push myself out of my comfort zone and find some girl after college, but trust me its not as easy as it sounds. I tried pushing myself and talked to girls from Insta, FB and even reddit and exchanged number too, but face to face I shy.

The advice of joining dating apps doesn't really work for men. I look decent, but still don't get too many matches. When you date someone from school or college the trust factor is really high and you aren't a random guy on the Internet who is trying to impress girls with looks. You are better off with average looks too, saw a lot of friends doing this.

**Actionable Tip:** If you are a shy guy, push yourself out of your comfort zone and talk to girls **while you are in college.** It would be really difficult once college is over. Trust me I've burnt my fingers.

I would be expected to marry someone few years down, and am already feeling anxious thinking about all this because I don't want to go through arrange marriage route. I feel am too old now to get over my shyness and nothing can be done now despite my strong desire to push myself (am stuck at my hometown due to covid and wfh so not in a metro, which is also affecting me to push myself), I'm losing my hope and wanted to share this with young bros here so that they don't make the same mistake I made.

I can't sleep late, let it be because of homework or any other reason, nor am I supposed to sleep till late in the morning, I am supposed to wake up at 5 in the morning and start studying. and wake up in the middle of the night and start studying.

I cant order anything I want, I don't get any sort of pocket money, nothing.\[ I'm fine with this\]

my friends abandoned me because I could never go with them when they invited me.

and now too I can't go out with friends if there is a girl by any chance!

also, I don't get to make any decisions in my life, what to study, where to study, why to study, etc...\[this thing is a really big bummer for me\]

I don't even do anything like drinking or smoking or any other illegal drugs!

overall less money to spend on globally equally                         -overall more money to spend on globally

 priced stuff like a camera                                                                  equal priced products like a camera

628,Unpopular opinion+Rant+ Vent: Mother-in-law average at cooking. But doesn't realize it.,"I guess I'm just venting here. I'll start off with my experience. 

My Mother-in-law, who's visiting us ,  loves to cook. I appreciate the love and care put into each dish. She loves to look up new recipes to try. It's mostly average cooking with the occasional dish that stands out.

Fair enough, who doesn't like food served to them with zero effort. ? yum.

But, every time she makes a dish I'm asked for my opinion. It's not bad per se, but the woman has no nuance for masalas. Everything has the same dozen  or so masalas. It's not even about the spice level, it's just a flood of masalas. I've tried giving my honest opinion once ina while, but she eventually comes to the conclusion "" oh, you probably don't like masaladar/spicy food"".

Now I do quite a bit of cooking. I do modify recipes I find online, but keep the majority unchanged. 

But this woman is on a crusade against allowing other recipes to exist. 

What are we having tonight? Chicken curry, roan josh or korma. Doesn't matter. Needs more masala.

Butter Chicken? Not enough masala. Pheeka . Let me add some stuff.

Tandoori chicken ? Not enough masala.  Let me add some stuff.

Chicken nuggets? Not enough masala inside?Let me add some stuff.

Momo's? Not enough masala. Let me add some stuff.

Biryani? Doesn't matter what regional variety, all masala are going in.

Almost everything she cooks had the same basic masalas whether or not  it complements the flavor profile. 

It's a nightmare to bring food from outside as chances are she will criticize it and spoil the mood. 
The worst part is that  she will attempt her ""improved"" recipe and present it the next day. 

Recently she kept asking about a dish that she could prepare for me. I finally gave in and asked for one.  Next day dish is ready. Yup. No nuance and nothing like what it was supposed to be.

She attempted shammi kebabs. With ground meat. And her special extra spices.  She proudly stated that she looked up the recipe for galauti kebabs, thought she could ""improve"" upon it since she found galauti kebabs to be meh and lacking flavor.  Somewhere in the process detoured to shami kebab. It turned out to be a Frankenstein generic kabab-shammin kebab hybrid.

I have stopped taking her to restaurants as 90% of the time will be spent criticizing the food. I've stopped cooking as well as it's just going to be criticized for not having enough masala. 

Even my mom has average cooking skills with some signature dishes which are quite good. But at least she is self-aware about limitations and willing to learn and follow recipes.

/End rant 

What has r/India's experience been with home cooking? I understand staple meals need to be uncomplicated and quick to cook . But some people just stop any improvement process and instead criticize food around them. I know they come from a place of love, but  where is the self-awarness?",144,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

630,Swiggy & Zomato are fucking up your Hormones.,"Ordered food online through an app? chances are it came packed in that cheap white plastic container.

As soon as you put hot anything into plastic container that too the most cheap non food grade garbage that most restaurants use to pack your fav sambar or dal makhni, you are adding a nice tadka of BPA and other endocrine disruptors to your body.

End result? Both men and women get their hormones fucked. Men will have low testosterone (male hormone), more estrogen (female hormone)

Women will develop things like PCOD and other menstrual issues. 

Couples trying to conceive will have difficulty in conceiving, pregnant ladies will effect the health of their baby and increase risk of miscarriage. And so on.....

So be extremally cautious while eating food packed in cheap plastic containers.

631,Why are indian professors so rude for unnecessary reasons,"Before I rant I just wanna say that i know I shouldn't be generalizing and i get there are good teachers and bad teachers  everywhere but just hear me out. 

The amount of times I have seen professors in my university taking out their frustrations on students for no reason at all. Doesn't matter if you are right or wrong . They don't even help you out most of the time. It's just constant aggressive tone and the mean taunts they give.  My whole faculty is just bunch of middle aged people who are just frustrated with their jobs.  Each and every professor here is just so unapologeticly rude to you. And it's not just me who thinks that. I have talked to my friends who are studying in different fields/Universities like engineering or Arts students and all of them have the same issue aswell. 

And  I know there would be people who'll say stuff like ""oh stop whining, develop a thick skin"" ""this is what life is "" bla bla I know. But honestly sometimes their comments do nothing but demoralizes you more than you already are struggling.

The user may/may not like the app, and can rate the app according to their experience, but when has this become a criteria for rating the app? How can they be rude for a service they are availing for free as if they own it? For someone, who does not spend much on marketing, every 1 star takes a dump on the organic reach for the app.

633,[UPDATE] I got a Rs. 9K hard disk with (literal) junk inside it from Flipkart,"See my original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ryxm3m/i_got_a_rs_9k_external_hard_disk_with_no_disk/).

TL;DL I bought a 5TB external hard disk from Flipkart for \~9000 rupees but I got an open box with an empty hard disk shell inside it (no storage) I made that post on the same day when I bought it.

It was very anxious the following days, I had to do a lot of waiting and there were a lot of technical issues that I had to face during communication.

They wanted me to send them a picture of my ID proof (both sides) as well as pictures of the package I received. I agreed to do so reluctantly.

The problem is, I couldn't reply to their email as their email server was rejecting my mail as ""spam"", I tried this multiple times from different email providers so this is definitely not an issue on my end.

I tried to use their website's messaging feature, but that too was malfunctioning and only sent 1 of the pictures out of the 5 I picked... and the kicker is that I couldn't send any more messages after that due to yet another technical issue.

After a couple of days they REJECTED my refund request! I called again and this time they said that I was wrong for choosing the ""Item is missing"" option as the return reason... so I placed another request with the other option about the item being defective.

The same process about sending pictures etc. began again with the same technical difficulties.

In the meanwhile I had also sent an email to the ""Chief Grievance Officer"" of Flipkart detailing all of my issues in detail, only to be never heard about it ever again.

A day or two pass by and when I was casually checking the refund status of the order I found out that it was REJECTED AGAIN.

This was the last straw, I was fed up and I had to escalate this matter.

I decided to file an official dispute to my bank as I had bought this with my Credit Card, it was perhaps the best decision I made till then, I promptly filled out the dispute form and wrote a letter with all the details along with some pictures too.

The VERY NEXT DAY I get a call from Flipkart that my refund has been approved and that my money will be credited back in a few days... and then another call from another department probably, this time the lady on the other end sounded more pissed off and she abruptly cut the call once I said I didn't get the money in my card yet. She also spoke in Hindi while all the others spoke in English.

The bank provided me with a temporary credit so that I don't suffer, and the actual refund arrived a few days later. They didn't even bother picking up the trash they sent me.

So lesson learned: **Avoid buying from Flipkart unless you have to! And when you do buy something, especially something expensive, make sure you make a video of it!**

Out of curiosity I decided to open up the hard disk enclosure and I was surprised to discover that it was filled with junk (pieces of cardboard from the corpse of another WD box, maybe the scamster did this multiple times). Here's the image I took: [https://i.imgur.com/RZSAY9R.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/RZSAY9R.jpg)

I guess the silver lining of this whole fiasco is that I got a free HDD enclosure.",192,Rant / Vent,"Flair_id    dc76fe88-664e-11ec-b768-7a1c22db6418

641,Unpopular Opinion,"I believe Indian liberalism has a flaw. It ignores the oppressive and problematic parts of Islam and rather than trying to abolish them, it embraces them, and that's the problem. I just can't understand why speaking against regressive practices of Hinduism and other religion is liberalism and speaking against regressive practices of Islam is Islamophobia/racism. Liberals in India are slowly converting into Islamic apologists and are supporting orthodox practices in the name of secularism. Liberals have literally started glorifying face veils.

Many so called intellectuals are saying hijab/burkha is opressive or not isn't the discussion, the discussion is should they allowed in school/colleges or not. But i believe before asking wether it should be allowed or not ask yourself why face veils exist in the First Place? 
Parda, ghoongat, hijab, burqa all are used to oppress women and against the right of freedom of speech and expression. Women shouldn't look towards men or shouldn't talk to them was the basic idea behind those things. No matter how much you will justify face veils, you can't change the fact that it has oppressive origins.

Now comes to the main point, should Hijab allow in schools/colleges?
If a school/college has no dress code, then even if you come in burkha or any other religious attire no one has the right to stop you and if anyone does then it will violate your fundamental rights. But if a school/college has a uniform that is mandatory for all then just come to school in the prescribed uniform. I can't understand what's the problem with wearing a uniform. Uniforms were started in schools so that everyone irrespective of their class, status, religion, caste should come in the same clothes so that there shouldn't be any discrimination. No one should look rich/poor or different from each other. We all have been punished/denied entry into our schools someday for wearing improper uniforms or having long hair/nails. No one had a problem with that, but now people are protesting for allowing something in school that is historically oppressive. They are advocating for an orthodox practice to be allowed in schools. Today you want to allow hijab, tomorrow someone will come in burkha and say that it's their religious identity, what will happen then?

I believe banning Face veils in educational institutes, that has been done by many countries is a good step toward discouraging this opressive social practice.
No one is stopping any particular religion to get an education, just wear the proper uniform that is being applied to everyone equally.

You can't deny the fact that face veils are forced on [most] women directly or indirectly by their parents and community forces. Lakhs of women in regressive countries are forced to follow sexist sariya laws and thousands are fighting against it. And I believe calling hijab women's rights will be disrespectful to all the women who are fighting against this.",1387,Politics,"Flair_id    77f04f12-7ea0-11e3-ac66-22000a0b8292

642,Unpopular Opinion : Your views on Hijab are immaterial to what's happening to the girls in Karnataka,"1) It's not a debate about liberalisation of Muslim society, it isn't being done as a great favour to Muslim women. A single Muslim girl coming to school to receive an education, on a scooter, alone (even when she is clad in a burqa) is women empowerment. Bhagwa clad men rushing towards her shouting Jai Shree Ram - isn't liberalisation, it's targeted harassment. Barring Muslim women from getting an education isn't empowering.



2) This is not a debate on uniforms. Most of these colleges/schools have allowed girls to come in burqas even before this. Some have even directly stated that the reason they are now forbidding is because Hindutva miscreants have threatened violence. Also uniforms aren't the great equaliser you think they are - people from  lower socioeconomic strata still face a lot of ridicule if their uniforms are unclean/torn. Teach your children to respect everyone irrespective of clothes - uniforms don't do jackshit other than to homogenise a diverse society. That's why the Brits introduced and loved it so much.



3) It's about protecting the constitutionally guaranteed rights of minorities, the fundamental right to freedom of every citizen in the country. They should be able to do whatever they want in whichever clothes they deem fit. Hijab, Niqab, Burqa, Pagdi, Kirpan, Tilak, Bindi, saree, salwar - teach your children to respect all of them as they are ALL a part of India's reality, all part of our social fabric. You can choose not to agree to the choice of others, but respect,dignity and kindness should be shown towards everyone - particularly don't hinder anyone of going about trying to carve out a livelihood, don't deny anyone education or health. 

PS : If you truly care about women empowerment, start by looking at your own home. Pay your househelp a good wage for her labour, share your household chores with your wife/mom, empower your women to be equal to a man in her ambitions, career etc, don't leech or leer at them, stop cracking sexist jokes and please, fucking please -  listen to them, hear them out.",3222,Politics,"Flair_id    77f04f12-7ea0-11e3-ac66-22000a0b8292

665,Gujarat's religious divide.,"There is this myth of the Gujarat Model so I wish more people from Gujarat start speaking up. 

When I was young we were enjoying childhood with everyone in school. But we all knew Muslims were in a way shoved in the outskirts of the village or city like some outcasts. Now ever since my teenage years when Modi came into power things are just getting more delusional as in my friends who were spending so much time with Muslims don't like them anymore. 

And now I just graduated and noticed that equally qualified and talented ppl are not getting jobs in GIDC purely because they are Muslims. Muslims work in trades that are run by Muslims. My eye doc is Muslim and easy 95% of his patients are Muslims. I went to a restaurant run by a Muslim and all the customers were Muslims. They live together in a community and are not given housing in regular areas. What I'm trying to generalize is Muslims have stopped contacting everyone who is not Muslim, and in all other areas they almost are invisible. The separation is widening crazily, rarely they are seen in regular clinics, food stalls etc. And even if they do they come as a big family of 10-15 ppl in huge cars. Maybe if they're alone in public then are not wearing their religious clothes or like some vendors, I talked to hiding their names. 

This is honestly sad and I can not even imagine how worse it would be for the next generation. I'm not  Gujarati but grew up here so this was very odd for my family, but even my dad slips some weird statements that make me and mom deeply uncomfortable, I'm sad he is getting influenced too.

683,My two cents on the ongoing hijab controversy as a muslim woman,"This is going to be a long post. I'll try to keep it as cohesive as I can. 
The last couple of days we have seen a huge amount of posts and all sorts of opinions. Some justifying the ban, some against it. 

I'll start with my own experience with hijab. I come from a very orthodox family but since my father worked away from my hometown, I grew up in a very open minded environment. We would visit my relatives once a year. Up until 12 th I was living in bubble thinking my family was progressive and not patriarchal. Ofcourse I was wrong. As soon as I finished 12th, my relatives started talking about getting me married. My mom obviously said no but they kept saying ""jyada aazadi mat do, ladki bigad jayegi"". This honestly freaked me out. I am a loud person, have tons of guy friends. I didn't want to be talked about, so I decided I would wear hijab. I wanted to explore my religion but I also wanted to not be talked about. Also since no one in my entire family, relatives or distant relatives ever wore a hijab, I was getting a lot of respect. No body was trash talking me anymore. Funny isn't it. I was a topper, studying at a prestigious university but irrespective of all my hardwork, I was respected for wearing a hijab. Nobody forced me to wear it, nobody said anything when I took it off 5 years later. In those 5 years I went from a student to an engineer. I became the first even women from my family to graduate. The first ever woman to work. I also became confident and less worried about people's opinions. Nobody back home questioned me for taking off the hijab. Would I ever go back to wearing it. No. Do i care if other women wear it. No. The reason I gave this history is because I know both sides, the girls who are fighting for their right to wear hijab and the ones who think hijab is patriarchal. I relate to them a lot more than some of you. All of the decisions I took were my own. I wasn't banned for it. I wasn't forced to wear it.

Now coming back to the hijab controversy. Why are people so against hijab. The first reason could be uniformity in schools. No religious display should be allowed in school. All are equal and should wear same uniforms with no exceptions allowed. But if we are taking this path, shouldnt we ban everything religious. I studied in a government school. We celebrated hindu festivals, inaugurations or welcome ceremonies were done the Hindu way. Our prayer song was in Sanskrit. We had ramayan and mahabharat in our syllabus. And whole lot of things I don't remember were specific to the Hindu culture. Are we gonna ban all those things too. Because if wearing hijab to a place of education is wrong, then wearing turban is also wrong, then all the Hindu traditions followed at schools is also wrong.



Coming to the second reason, forcing women to wear hijab is patriarchal. Okay. But what is it that people want to achieve over this ban. Some of these young girls wear it out of there own will, some are forced. The parents will pull their daughters out of schools/ colleges over this. These girls will end up getting married. What are the girls benefiting from? We can't change the mentality of the parents, but if the girl is educated, she may not enforce the same on her daughter. We should be giving these women a chance to rise up in the society. Change doesn't come overnight. If you think, banning hijab will change the thinking of those muslim parents then you are wrong. I am a feminist but I know it for a fact that my outrage over their hijab will not do them any good. I understand where these people are coming from, i understand why some muslim women who never wore hijab are wearing it now. It is to stand in solidarity with the rest. No religion is without fault, Islam certainly isn't but honestly when a religion is attacked again and again and again, what do you expect people to do. 

And the most important issue of it all, why do we keep forgetting that all of this is political. The government doesn't care for muslim women. They are just spreading hatred and lies. It's election time. 

Stop bashing people for their beliefs. It is hard to throw these away when they are so interwoven in our lives. These poor girls have done nothing wrong. They have every right to practice their religion just like you and me. Let's be better humans and not fall into this propaganda hellhole.",703,Politics,"Flair_id    77f04f12-7ea0-11e3-ac66-22000a0b8292

702,The hatred against reservations in education is stupid and infuriating,"At the outset, I am a general male with no additional quota, studying in a government College that took me 3 attempts to get. I mention this only because the very first counter to defending reservation is usually ""only a general student would know"". I didn't get a satisfactory college in my first two attempts, but I am aware enough to know that the fault lies with the government and not the reservation system.

0.05%. That's the acceptance rate for MBBS in AIIMS. In comparison, the acceptance rate of Harvard Medical is 3.5%. Cracking competitive exams in India is very hard, and I am more than well aware of it. But the reason behind less seats is..... less seats. Not reservation. In a country of such a massive population, we fail to establish institutions for quality education. With such limited and exclusive options, it is obvious that access would be extremely restricted. While anger for this should be aimed at the government, the single most hated aspect instead becomes reservations. People are so blinded by this hate that they buy into any propaganda, even the most recent one where NEET PG AIR 2 allegedly failed to get a derma seat in MAMC. [Here](https://mcc.nic.in/WebinfoMedical/File/ViewFile?FileId=4543&LangId=P) is the counseling list if anybody wishes to cross-check, AIR 82 got said branch without having any quota. 

Reservations are not going anywhere. They are especially needed in education. And no, they shouldn't be based on economic status, and that's a whole separate debate. Hold the government accountable. Ask for more institutions. Stop hating your peers for the incompetence of those in power.",347,Politics,"Flair_id    77f04f12-7ea0-11e3-ac66-22000a0b8292

710,I keep seeing the flawed comparison of burqas to Sikhi Pagaris and its simply wrong,"Hijabs/Burqas and Pagaris are not the same thing.

Hijabs/Burqas/Ghoongats are a patriarchal tool to suppress women and keep them in line. They are forced to keep in the dark to satisfy the ego and lust of men. The fact that women have to wear such a thing to keep themselves safe from gaze is wrong in itself, she shouldn't be frightened to go out to begin with.

I dont see Kaurs beating up Sikh men for not wearing the Pagari, and there is much more freedom if the man chooses not to wear the Pagari as opposed to the intense and unspoken pressure muslim women face if they choose not to wear the hijab/burqa. The Pagari (along with the 5Ks) comes from a position of power, while the burqa is a symbol of existential censorship.

The comparison is made in bad-faith and must stop, as the historical context is often dropped for the sake of posturing.

The only correct answer to this mess is: Hijab/Burqa must be banned, but not under the pressure of RW forces for communal reasons. The liberal sphere must not be used for communal apologists, online or irl to make a nest in to dunk on other religions. Educational campaigns must be held to slowly remove this symbol of oppression from our society (like it has been done in countless muslim countries).

**The most loudest voices for any patriarchal veil tend to be religious, bigoted men and that explain more than half of the issue.**

731,How many of you living abroad have slowly given up on the idea of ever coming back due to the extremist nationalism that has engulfed India?,"There might be a lot of clichés in this post but I assure you all of it is heartfelt.  

I am 28 years old now. 
When I moved out of India when I was 18. I has promised myself I'll make something of myself and return home by 30. Whatever I learned in those great universities, the connections and money I make, I was to come back and make a positive change in my own country.

I have been planning the final steps for 2 years now to the point that I don't even make close friends here on purpose so I don't get too attached to thie place. 

But the seeds of doubt have been sown since demonetisation. While most of the country was rejoicing in this ""masterstroke"" I couldn't help but feel afraid at the insane level of callousness of such a move and just as I feared, it was a failed experiment which did not work.
In fact what pisses me off the most is that there is a new breed of Indians that engage solely in what aboutery, they put their heart and soul into defending a government at the expense of the country's progress, jobs, economy, unity, peace or her future.

India right now is an overwhelming failure on the world stage. A few over valued startups are not what defines the promise a country holds. The echo chamber that most people in India currently live in is astoundingly disturbing. It is further exacerbated by the state of Indian media. I know most of you know how pathetic it is but I can't help but think everyone knows its all made up garbage, even those who religiously watch the verbal abuse disguised as debate on Republic TV. They all know its all a fake show and yet everyone is just okay with that. 99% of the country might be suffering in silence because that 1% on social media have a bigger voice than everyone else. 

Let's not even get into the crazy amount of hate speeches, call for violence, attacks on churches and schools. How Could it be that the Islamic Emirates run by absolute monarchies are more peaceful? Well a lot of it comes down to the fact their citizens have money. Almost every country prioritises making their citizens wealthier. Not India though. It is a fact that the Indian govt has taxed the hell out of India, especially fuel taxes which seems to be the only way for the govt to balance its books. 


Beating China is out of the question now, we are much closer to being beaten by Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh. In such a climate, moving back to India seems like the worst idea ever and sadly, by almost all metrics moving back to India has far too many disadvantages than staying where I am. Although it makes me extremely sad that I have come to take this decision because it was absolutely my dream to do something worthwhile, succeed in my own country and affect the lives of my own people for the better.",424,Politics,"Flair_id    77f04f12-7ea0-11e3-ac66-22000a0b8292

735,Dear Indians…,"Just a 3am thought, ( even tho it’s 2:30 here rn). Me and my sister were just talking about how some people we know from here in Pakistan had to travel to India for medical treatments. And I’ve just wanted to say I’ve alwayssss wanted to visit India some day. Your country looks really beautiful honestly and I wish I could visit Mumbai somebody for real. And maybe try out the veggie food you have there. 

And the maharaja Big Mac and idk I just imagine India to have amazing street food. Also here we all kinda grow up watching Indian movies and we listen to a lot of Indian music. Like it’s a must in our weddings and ap dhillon is huge in my uni lol. Guess what here in Lahore, some management company ripped off ppl selling fake ap dhillon tickets. Anyway, just wanted to let you guys know here is someone who has always wanted to visit India, try the dosa, bhel puri wagera, travel in that cycle rickshaw you guys have, actually go to the places and eat the foods that I’ve seen in movies n seasons. 

Also on a side note, really wanna talk to an Indian and see how different our dialects are. And did you guys know your YouTubers n ig ppl are kinda huge here as well. Apart from copycats or idk some stand ups, dholy Singh, that vishu guy who looks Andrew Garfield and many others are big here. Also I usually don’t watch much Hindi/Urdu stuff but I love Queen, highway, dear zindagi, sky is pink, wagera. ( my psych recommended dear zindagi n actually copied srk xD) also mirzapur n sacred games were huge here. Also shows like lust stories, basically quite much of Indian Netflix originals. Btw a huge population of ppl here has grown up watching star worlds lol n even shows like shararat n cid. XD (used to love that one where a kid had a magic pencil turning drawings into real things)

So ig I’m gonna end it at, I really wanna go to Mumbai some day n roam in the streets, eat the Delhi food n go to a beach in India perhaps n visit some art galleries!! Also ritviz the composer is well again pretty known here. So idk if any of this comes off as surprise or not but one of my online Indian friends was shocked that we wear saris here as well. And then another friend from Delhi once said how we pakis have such a different accent. So I wonder what’s it like to visit India (and have the veggie food esp).

Ps have had fam n ppl visit your country so heard stories in childhood. And they sounded nice.

Also another ps, hope this doesn’t gets bashed.

Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE AWARDS AND THE WARMTH, YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING! <3. 

I’m glad you guys found this wholesome and this made people happy. Wasn’t expecting such a warm response and the love but honestly thank you and here’s to people being bro’s and the desire to visit each other’s country. Also I loved reading the responses.

736,I Hate My Father,"I (F19) hate my father here is why. I don't know if I should post here but I just want to vent.

Today my father just ""explained"" how hard disks and software updates works to my mother who is a senior software engineer at the biggest software company in the world, Microsoft, has worked in some of the biggest companies in the world, you name it and she must have worked there, Dell, Infosys, IBM, TCS. My mother has studied CS from one of the best universities in India. He literally said, ""you must have not worked with laptops because this is how a laptop works"".

My father has horrible takes:

* Thinks being gay is a disease
* Bisexuals are just a notch above from pedophiles and zoophiles (while I have friends who are bisexual)
* Fight for abortion is unnecessary, ""just have the baby"" also he constantly tries to convince me to have kids, when I know I just cannot take on that stress and care too much about my career.
* All Muslims and Sikhs are terrorists and anti-nationals

Now my father is also a software engineer but here is an abysmal career timeline:

* Started working at a mid-size software company, he then started to bitch about his female boss to his junior workers, so she played office politics and fired him, basically. We used to live near our extended family at the time, this forced us to move to a new city, which is 2000kms away (actually).
* Then started working at a new mid-size company and did the same bullshit, to a male boss, and got fired again and then he stayed unemployed for a year
* My father started a start-up, asked my mother for support, financially abused her of her own money, and the company still failed, he would wake up at 8 in the morning and wouldn't leave for work till 12, he had even employed a few people. My father even admitted to her that he never worked hard enough for it. Now wouldn't that be heart wrenching for anyone.
* My father started many new star-ups and still continues to do so, at this point my father must have started at least 4 businesses
* Cheated my widowed maternal grandmother of ₹2lacs ($2.5K).
* My grandmother considers him unemployed since the day my father left his second job, which is 8 years now.

And a few months back had the audacity to whine about how no one supports him in any of his endeavors and literally said, ""why is everyone so concerned about me being unemployed, your mother was also unemployed for 2 years"" she was unemployed because she was pregnant with my younger brother, 12 years ago.

This is the same man who has always talks about his ""glory"" days when his first company sent him to the USA, Paris and Russia for a project. Those things happened more than 10 years ago. And he still repeats each and everything that happened there in excruciating details, sometimes everyone rolls their eyes when he starts with his stories. My mother even annoyingly completes his stories because they are that drilled into our head.

How can I like a person like this, who literally hates everyone around him and clearly uses people.",1534,Non Political,"Flair_id    8f105a84-7ea0-11e3-bba1-12313b0c91be

737,I bargained for Rs. 10 after spending Rs. 2k. I am not proud.,"I feel terrible today. I was returning home after spending Rs. 2k at an upscale restaurant in Delhi. I wanted to take an e-rickshaw and asked the driver how much he'd charge. He asked for Rs. 30 and for some reason, I impulsively started bargaining and told him that Rs. 20 was enough. He didn't budge, neither did I and I told him that I'd rather walk back home then and I went on. Then he stopped me again and told me that he's fine with Rs. 20.

Why did I bargain for 10 rupees after spending 2k and not batting an eye? Why did I not question whether the pizza I ate was worth Rs. 600, but was able to conclude that the distance to my home was certainly not worth Rs. 30? Did I bargain just because I knew that the less privileged driver was an easy target to polish my ego on? 

I want to know if others have faced similar situations around them, and what, if anything, should our approach be towards these. Firstly, is it ethical to bargain in places where one can? If one earns well enough, should one be more considerate of the lesser privileged like street vendors, etc. and not try to bargain with them, especially since many families are in desperation due to the lockdowns and the impact of COVID in general?

749,Going vegan in India is a luxury and not everyone's cup of tea.,"My friend turned vegan a while ago and it has become a part of her personality. Don't get me wrong i appreciate people going vegan but i don't think it's viable in context with india. 
1. It's super expensive to buy or make almond/soya milk. Coconut milk might be cheaper but still expensive in north indian cities. 
2. In an Indian family it's difficult to implement or cook special item for vegan people.  This can be extremely time consuming and tedious for the one who prepares the food or others might have to adjust the eating habits that of vegans.
3. Going to a vegan restaurant is expensive and has limited options.

I have come across people who boost going vegan so much so that they can make it part of their personality where it's no longer a lifestyle. I see people baking vegan cheesecakes and trying to force western vegan habits to middle class mindset. 
I would just suggest just eat dal, roti and rice and go to sleep.

Edit: People are pointing out that vegan options that are available. And i know ofcourse there are hundreds of them. I just mentioned dal, roti and rice above.  But i like to stress upon the general trend of people where they are not willing to compromise on their eating habits or eliminate certain products. They just want to replace the dairy products with vegan options.",241,Non Political,"Flair_id    8f105a84-7ea0-11e3-bba1-12313b0c91be

754,"Another reason to be careful in Canada -- 2,000 Indian students scammed as 3 Canadian colleges shut after bankruptcy.","\>Over 2,000 Indian students, who face an uncertain future after three Montreal colleges closed last month by declaring bankruptcy, have demanded intervention by the Canadian government to give them justice.

The CCSQ College, M. College, and CDE College had collected millions of dollars in tuition fees from these students before closing.

The students, many of whom have moved to different cities to stay with friends or relatives, say they have been scammed.

They are staging rallies to highlight their plight.

As some of the impacted students and their supporters raised slogans for justice at a rally in the Toronto suburb of Brampton on Wednesday, anxiety was writ large on their faces.

They shouted slogans seeking intervention by the Canadian government to help them complete their courses from other colleges.

Those who were nearing completion of their courses must be allowed to finish on the basis of their old credits, they demanded.

Many said they are running out of money as they cannot legally work for 20 hours a week - as allowed to international students.

Manpreet Kaur, a student from Longowal in Punjab, said she had deposited over $14,000 annual fee at M. College and was waiting to start her classes in early childhood education in January when the college declared bankruptcy.

""When I landed in Canada on October 9, I was told that since the college couldn't find enough students the classes would start in January. But on January 6, students got an email about the college going bankrupt. It smacks of a scam,"" said Manpreet who finished her masters in computers in India before coming to Canada.

Vishal Rana, a student from Karnal who was studying at CCSQ college to become medical office specialist, said, ""I had just four months left of my 16-month course when the college suspended studies. I don't know where to go.""

Rana had paid $24,000 in fees.

Harwinder Singh, who came from Pehwa in Haryana to study a two-year business management course at M. College, said, ""I deposited $21,500 for this course and I have finished only six months of my course. I am surviving on some money I saved while working. I don't know what will happen.""

Gurkamaldeep Singh, a student from Moga, said he would have finished his business management course from M. College by June. ""Now my biggest worry is whether I have to redo my course. We are told that the government has given the colleges to find buyers so that studies can resume.""

Gurkamaldeep said the students should be allowed to complete the remaining part of their courses at other institutions.

""We should give us course completion letters so that we can join other colleges and also apply for work permits in order to survive,"" he said.

Over 700 students, who were taking online classes sitting in India, are among those who have been impacted by the closure of these colleges.

755,Toxic Culture in Indian Tech Sector,"As an outsider, the Indian tech sector appears to be booming, progressing, etc. There's at least one multi-million dollar fund-raising news in the Indian start-up ecosystem. Everything looks rosy and optimistic for the Indian tech scene. 

But from an insider's perspective, things are not so rosy. In fact, in my opinion, it's the opposite. Indian start-up culture is pretty toxic. This is coming from my own experience of working in a leading/top Indian start-up and from multiple accounts of knowns/friends. The recent news around BharatPe is an example of this. The company is in the unicorn club, raising multiple rounds of investments. But a simple glassdoor search of the company could shed some light on their culture. The ratings are terrible and there are multiple reviews of the hideous culture inside. A website named 'Blind' can also give up an insider look into the tech culture, given it's anonymous. Search for any so-called 'leading' tech companies, be it: Ola, Flipkart, Udaan, etc, and you'll know the reality. 

What is the reason for this? Is it the same across the world? Is a corporate setting by design toxic? I think Google and Microsoft are a good examples of a decent work culture? Is it an Indian thing? With the growing competition within start-ups, it's only going downhill, with no signs of redemption.",232,Non Political,"Flair_id    8f105a84-7ea0-11e3-bba1-12313b0c91be

758,Does anyone feel like our Tier-2 cities are actually more liveable than our tier-1s?,"I was born and raised in Chennai, and spent most of my summers in Mumbai because my dad works there. 

I’ve recently moved to Coimbatore and have been living there for 1 year and the difference is day and night.

The air is cleaner, the water is cleaner, the roads are better, and public transport isn’t crowded all the time. It literally feels like a different country, especially for someone who spent his entire life in metro cities. 

Internet used to be a problem in the past, but now every town has fibernet so even that is on par with metros. 

Young people might find such cities boring, because there isn’t much nightlife and exclusive stuff, but if you just wanna chill and live with family, it’s far better than being stuck in traffic for 4 hours in a metro city highway.

Less density means there are more open spaces and green parks too. Low cost of living too, nowhere near Mumbai/Bangalore level expensive.

I wanna know how can we actually change India for good in a way that an average Indian can live a life where basic human rights and opportunities aren't a luxury.

People really like to prioritise things like higher GDP and better military, and while I would really like us to be better at both of these, I don't think they should be our first priority. I think we (and by we, to some extent I also mean the government) should prioritise things like HDI, Happiness index, Urbanization and Literacy.

773,"I [M28, Indian] am going through a bad breakup, due to arranged marriage"," This may be a long post, any help and comments are appreciated.

I \[M28\] met this girl \[F25\] (let's call her Nisha) at the office in Feb 2019 I was in a relationship that ended by the end of 2019 (due to reasons unrelated), technically Nisha and I didn't meet we were both in different cities of India working for the same project. As I was leaving that project Nisha was my replacement for a project she was freshly graduated and I was responsible for training her so our friendship began.  
I was dealing with my previous breakup till like Feb of 2020 (was pretty emotional too), then the pandemic started and we all were working from home. Mind you Nisha and I were not working in the same company, we were in different cities and never met but were occasionally talking on Whatsapp. Whenever Nisha has any difficulties in her office work she used to text me and generally that is what we used to talk about. I used to help her as a friend first but gradually started developing feelings (anyone would she is beautiful and sweet) but didn't tell her cuz we never met.  
By the end of 2020, we were talking on the phone more than usual and on 31st Dec 2020, I confessed my feeling, to which to my surprise I received a positive response. But at that time she made it clear let's not fall in love because her family is very conservative and won't allow marrying a boy from a different caste, state, and one who speaks a different language (my mother tongue is Marathi hers is Hindi). But still, we were in love somehow and I was a bit hopeful and stupid too, though I will manage because considering her brother managed to marry out of caste and had a love marriage.  
Things get complicated now, after 6 months of such a relationship we were closer than ever though we never met and she was also dependent on me for her daily office work as I will guide her in studies or stuff. But in the background, it was depressing also because there were thoughts in her and my mind that we will not be able to live together because of her family issues and I was losing hope. Then she changed her job and joined an organization in a city where I'll live once WFH is over (which is still not over). For both of us, it was clear that 2022 will be a year when we will have to break up. Still, we wanted to meet for once, so we did it met for a week in Nov 2021 for the first time after knowing each other for almost 2.5 years and 10 months of a relationship, it was a good time. There were some issues but that shit happens.  
During this whole time, my family had asked me to get married but somehow I made excuses and never listened to them and asked for time. Now that time is over and I will have to get married in 2022 (this may sound weird to people from western counties or even for some Indians but where I come from I need to think of this also, there are a lot of things depending on my marriage and it's a big thing for my parents also). So I ask Nisha to talk to her parents so that something can be done (she knew this was coming we had talked about it earlier also), but she says she won't be able to because there is no talk of her marriage in her house and she is afraid to ask and I understand that coming from very conservative and misogynist family that can be very difficult. My family knew about my relationship but we never talked about it openly. But they would have agreed for Nisha's, and my marriage would have taken some convincing.

After listening to Nisha's response that she can not talk to her family about me also she said ""**you should do whatever is best for you don't think about me**"" that would be hard for her but again our relationship is not going anywhere with this. So I decided I'll say yes to my family to arrange marriage which they were already preparing for without my yes (I know this is kind of selfish of me but it was difficult to wait for a girl who is not able to discuss me with her family and even if she asks after a year or two there is less than 5% chance that her family will agree). Also saying yes to arranged marriage was not easy for me I cried a lot alone, went through a lot of things alone could not tell her about all of this.  
As soon as I said yes to arrange marriage on 1st Jan 2022 I informed Nisha and she didn't ask me to revert my decision or anything but said the same thing do whatever is best for you. I told Nisha then we should not be in a relationship because if we are in a relationship I will not be able to focus on the arranged marriage thing I will feel like betraying someone or other. But this breakup was not the same as my previous one, Nisha is dependent on me for a lot of things in her life as well as work. So I wanted to support her as a friend through our breakup and afterward. So I suggested we should not stop talking but will reduce talking gradually and we'll behave as friends and no love thing. This is a very difficult and maybe a bad thing for a lot of you but I thought it will be difficult for her to manage without me so I didn't think it was right to break friendship also.  
But things are not going well since then, I am talking and met a girl (let's call her Mina) and probably will be marrying her. I am not in love with her but there is no reason I reject her in arrange marriage situation so I am considering this possibility of marrying Mina which can be good for me and my family. I have made clear to Nisha about this also, but she is not able to deal with it, she now says I could have waited for her and I was not in love with her I was using her. She says how can someone stop loving someone suddenly like this. I haven't stopped loving her, but I can not show my love to her if I am going to marry someone else, and Nisha also did nothing to stop me when I was asking.  
I still talk with Nisha when she calls (rarely I will call her) because I can not leave her alone I want things to be better, and I feel she needs my support. But if we are not going to marry and I am going to marry someone else things will change and I am not going to show boyfriend-like love to Nisha to give her false hopes. There has been a lot of fights with Nisha since last month over the phone but nothing seems to do any better. I suggested we should talk with a relationship counselor so that things can be better and it's easy to move on but he is not ready to do that also. I am also not in a good mental state right now there is a lot of pressure related to work, things with Nisha and parents pushing for arranged marriage I am so tired of all this. She wants me to behave normally but I don't know anymore how to behave normally.  
I don't want to play a victim here not I think she is and I am writing this as unbiased as possible, but circumstances led to this situation no one is at fault IMO. So tell me anything you feel about this, please.",19,Non Political,"Flair_id    8f105a84-7ea0-11e3-bba1-12313b0c91be

For some time now, I have been getting post from Kotak Mahindra addressed to some guy (let's call him Amit because that's his name) who has never lived here (I have lived here since the construction). Today two guys show up at my doorstep demanding to see Amit. I told them that no one by that name lives here. But they insisted that they have the right address and we cough up the pending debt  in a threatening tone. It was only after our neighbors showed up and also verified that no Amit lives here, that they relented and left.

785,"An incredible turnaround of Cafe Coffee Day, led by a widow","In July, 2019, the founder of Cafe Coffee Day: V. G. Siddhartha committed suicide. In a note, he blamed his lenders, partners and Income Tax officials for this extreme step. His company, Cafe Coffee Day, one of the most renowned Indian brands with more than 1700 outlets, was under severe debt of Rs 7200 crore at time. He couldn’t take it anymore. 

After he died, everyone assumed that the brand CCD, as we all know it, has died too. After all, who will handle this huge debt, and repay it?

But his wife, Malavika Hegde, had other plans. 

She took over the reins of a failing company, whose founder had committed suicide, and deployed some stunning management tactics and strategies, and brought down the debt to Rs 3100 crore by March 2020, and to Rs 1731 crore today. A reduction of 75% in two years!

In an inspiring note written to all stakeholders and employees, Malavika declared that this unbelievable reduction in loan: from Rs 7200 crore to Rs 1731 crore in two years, has been done without any favors from any lender, and she will not only repay every single penny back to them but also revive Cafe Coffee Day. 

An incredible turn-around, seldom seen in the corporate sector, especially when flamboyant entrepreneurs like Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi have fled their own country, and are hiding away in other countries with similar debts and liabilities. 

Malavika Hegde has shown what it means to be a true leader. She didn’t hide, she didn’t stop, she didn’t let Cafe Coffee Day die. She has set new benchmarks in displaying resilience, determination, and a firm will.

She is a hero.

797,Just had a minor op in a top Delhi hospital. It left me shaken.,"I am in Delhi on a family visit from England. Last week I heard that a much needed minor op on my hand was being delayed due to pressures on the National Health Service. Good job I was in Delhi, then. Saw a top surgeon on Wednesday, and was booked in for surgery on Thursday morning at a top multi specialty hospital. Miraculous! In pre-surgery prep, a test dose of antibiotic was delivered to my arm, resulting in immediate red flush all around the puncture wound. I showed it to the nurse, who showed it to a surgical nurse, who said it was minor. MISTAKE ONE. Fast forward to the OT. It’s a local anaesthetic surgery but there is a drip. Seconds after the antibiotic was administered, I felt awful. I started coughing violently, feeling nauseous, feeling like I was going to lose bladder control. Surgeon acted swiftly after seeing I had a rash on my chest and face. But instead of stopping and administering epinephrine, he administered iv antihistamines. The gamble paid off, but this is not the correct protocol. MISTAKE TWO. After recovering, I mentioned repeatedly that the reaction should be noted in the discharge. It wasn’t. During discharge, the nurse read through the medicines to take at home, including oral antibiotics. I had never heard of it before but I thought, surely, it would be safe. MISTAKE THREE. At home I brought out the antibiotics to take after dinner and lo! It was exactly the same formulation I had been given in IV form. Had I not checked the formulation, I would have been straight back in the emergency room. Maybe even dead. I called the hospital straight away and found out that the poor junior duty doctor who had written up my discharge hadn’t been told by the surgeon’s team that I had the reaction. There were three doctors in the OT, but no one took it upon themselves to report the reaction. Two nurses observed the test dose and didn’t want to stick their neck out to say there was a problem. Finally, a nurse READ through my discharge without acknowledging that the medicine was the same.

You can pay as much as you like, but the inaction and buck-passing will kill you given half the chance. Question everything. Demand answers. I’m glad I did.",1470,Non Political,"Flair_id    8f105a84-7ea0-11e3-bba1-12313b0c91be

799,It's ironic how some people are hypocrites.,"So there are 2 parts to this story. I am sure most of us know about the vandalization and attacks that happened in Bangladesh during the end of Durga Puja some 3 months ago. So one of my ex classmates (we are in 12th grade now, but we went to different schools after 10th grade) who is a blind follower of the ""bestest leader Modixi"" posts on his social media how Muslims are the scum of the earth and they should all leave India. Keep in mind that one of our classmates was Muslim and we have studied together for 12 years. So ofc I couldn't take that lying down. I said my own piece on social media, to which he replied that I am a Muslim bootlicker and people like me are the reason why Muslims keep destroying the country. It was highly assuming seeing him have a fit on Whatsapp about something like this, plus I often receive backlash for my stance on social issues anyway, so I was used to it. But it did make me a bit sad seeing him act so unhinged and call me such names after being his friend for so long. Anyway.

So I took those insults lying down and moved on. Now, about the Muslim classmate that I was talking about. She was one of my good friends during school life and the fact that we were from different religions hadn't ever crossed our minds. Cut to Christmas of last year, she posted a highly divisive video on her social feed about how people shouldn't wish her Merry Christmas because she was a Muslim and that Islam doesn't recognise Christmas. I was a bit surprised at this and asked her what was the point of that video as our generation should make an effort to rise out of such pettiness. After all, India is a secular country and this we vs. them mentality is harmful. She didn't try to explain her point and just said that I am attacking her because she was Muslim and that she is ""sorry"" she spoke her mind. The other day, she said, again on her socials, how Islam says the following things are haram and that one shouldn't engage in such sinful acts. And then she proceeded to list homosexuality. 🤡👍 As someone who is bi, this really stung me. I called her out on this, to which she said she isn't really aware of it. So like?? Don't comment on them then??

I now feel a bit foolish to have defended a faith which doesn't respect people like me. This is one thing which has always seemed ironic. Muslims say they are discriminated against, which is a totally valid argument at present here, but they don't see that their religion has also been doing the same to the queer community. Absolutely not saying that all Muslims are like this, but a vast majority are. I am also sad how school friendships are tainted by things that shouldn't absolutely have a say in them, but oh well, this is the new India.

Tl:dr; An ex classmate said derogatory remarks about Muslims, against which I protested. Another Muslim classmate said homosexuality is a sin. As a bi person, that really hurt me and now I feel a bit foolish to have defended a faith which doesn't really respect me for who I am.",196,Non Political,"Flair_id    8f105a84-7ea0-11e3-bba1-12313b0c91be

801,Women can be catfishes too. Stay safe online.,"I had a bad experience just recently. Like over a week ago, I saw a fun post, gave it an award, she sent the ‘Thanks for the award’ template dm. I said something, she replied and got to talking. 

We have been talking since. Exchanged pics on the second day. She gave me her telegram id on the fourth day along with her insta and twitter. We started sending voice clips after that. She gave me her number on the fifth day. 
Everything seemed great. But the problem was she was way too flirty since the first day. Towards the sixth and seventh day started telling me that she wants to be with me forever. On the eighth day she said the three magic words. 

I know what you guys must be thinking. This is too good to be true. I know. Which is why I was cautious. I played along with all of it but I was cautious. I don’t know how much of what she said is a lie. But she mixed in a lot of truth to it for sure. 

We talked on audio calls for more than 3 hours in total up until this point. We had talked about doing video calls soon. And even about meeting each other soon. 

Today, unprovoked, she sent me a baby picture of herself. That’s the mistake she did. I knew it wasn’t her picture. I asked her to come clean, she insisted it’s her and even made a fake chat convo screenshot with her ‘mom’ where her mom sends her this photo to prove to me. 

Well I’ve decided not to text her again. 

I’m glad she messed up so soon after we started talking. What if she hadn’t and played me for longer? Since she was a girl, and could actually have had video calls in the future, she genuinely could have played me for longer. 

She actually seems to have an entire alt persona. Including social media accounts, phone number etc. 

I don’t know why she lied. I’m sure she was just lonely but also didn’t want an online friendship to become anything serious. Which is totally understandable. But lying and manipulating others for that, that’s not cool.

Anyone can be a catfish. Just make sure you don’t fall for it. They might have sophisticated techniques to try and get away with it. But always be on the lookout. 

Stay safe and healthy you guys. 🤗🤗",20,Non Political,"Flair_id    8f105a84-7ea0-11e3-bba1-12313b0c91be

802,This is my suicide note,"It's strange when I'm thinking and have many things to say but while writing it's all feel distorted. Life , I feel like I have never lived expect some months in my post graduation. The person excerpted me as I am. I told her everything even about my social Anxiety which is curse of my life. I still remember the moment she hold my hand tightly to calm me down while my body was shaking due to anxiety. After sometimes it ended. I have no hard feelings against her and very grateful to her for good times I had. 
Now comes to main problem. I felt like facing my fear, people, it will become easier.but nah it's even harder. Suicide feels easier than facing a class full of students. I I feel like committing suicide daily. But fear of surviving suicide is even stronger. I wish I would never woke up when I go to sleep or will die in accident.
I can't share these things with anyone but I get some relief when I put these feelings in words or share with anyone. The thing I want to live and at the same time die but not committing suicide.

820,To my young buds and parents,"If there is one advice I wish I heard when I was a child would be to be really careful using porn, the dark process of its escalation and how it messes up your mind, consciousness, integrity, love and your entire life.

The one thing I wish I could’ve done is to quit it when I could, when I was young, before its dark hands gripped my brain strong, manipulated my thoughts for my entire life.

PORN IS A REALLY NASTY HIGHLY ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE. It sucks you out of your innocence, **it sucks you out of your love** and messes up your whole life just like any substance addiction does.

You might already know the fact that porn was a key player the exponential expansion of internet throughout the world. Porn was a big part of the web, it is, and will continue to do so as long as there will be internet.

The govt blocks it in one way, people can access by another. Its immutable.

In our country, internet is at its peak expansion today and will continue over the years. With the advent of online leaning, parents and government by giving children mobiles, tablets and laptops- the keys to this amazing and yet dark world of internet, we must advise these young curious minds on how to walk though the chaos and how to use internet judiciously for one’s growth

Children are always curious and they learn fast. You don’t have to teach a kid on how to use the web because he’ll definitely will figure out on his own. Parents cannot monitor what their child is looking at all the time. And just as they are curious, they are smart. They learn their parents and can deceive them very well to play their favourite games or watch some youtube/social media when they should be learning for school.

The internet today is anything but clean. Every website, ad, social media, youtube videos are projecting quasi-sexual contents to get peoples attention.

Also for males, the most sexual parts of the body is not what’s between his legs and rather his eyes and brain. Human males gets more sexually excited by seeing than any other sense.

All these factors- the accessibility of the internet, their age, sexualized contents, biology of brain, dopamine surge, novelty of porn and many more easily pave way for PORN ADDICTION.

The chances of a kid stumbling upon some porn is, simply put, extremely high. The chances of him getting hooked on it is also extremely high. Oh- and in children, the frontal part of the brain which is responsible for judgements and decision making is still in developing stage. It completes its development way later, during early adulthood. At the same time, the part of the brain that is responsible for motivation and dopamine release is fully functional. So part of the brain that says ‘do it’ is really active while the part that says ‘think about it’ is weak.  So ‘do it’ wins all the time and sadly they cant help it. That leads to compulsive sexual behavior which causes a series of bad situations whole life.

If you are a young boy reading this, just know that porn is just as bad and dangerous than any other addiction. You will hear a lot of opinions saying its safe, but don’t fall for those. All your free time will be used up by porn. You wont even have a hobby. You will choose porn when you’re sad, you will choose porn when you are stressed, you will use it first thing in the morning and last thing in bed. You wont know how to talk to girls and all the time you should be with friends and girls, exploring sexuality and intimacy in a healthy natural way, you will be in your dark room fapping to fucked up videos. Your view on women will be changed in a bad way. Including your loved ones. I could go on how it can fuck you up. And boy, it does, pretty bad.

Do whatever ways you can think of, use all your strength and stop watching porn. The sooner you quit, the easier it will be.

And to the parents reading this, please EDUCATE your children about porn. Just as about the dark sides of social media and gaming. Don’t tell them “Don’t watch porn” cos watching porn will be the next thing they will want to do. Instead, tell them how our body work sexually, what is healthy sexuality, what porn is, how fucked up the contents are, how a young mind can get hooked on, and how porn will effect the rest of his life. This works wayyy better than just putting parental controls/monitors, or yelling or beating him up if he is caught watching porn.

Also don't give them lots of privacy with phones/laptops in their hands. Check on them time to time, make sure that they are seeing it. 

In future, with unrestricted use of internet, a huge portion of our youth will become porn addicts. Lots of them cant get their thing up, all of them will have weird concept of sexuality, having low social life and proportionately lots of them will act out on their desires in real life and rape cases will skyrocket and crimes against children will be very high. Lots of broken marriages, lots of damaged brains, depression and deaths.

The internet can't do anything about it, the government can't do anything about it. Only the children and concerned parents could act against it and do something to decrease the number of people that end up in the above mentioned group, in future.

\-A 25 year old porn addict.

825,Unique Experience in Finding PG/Hostel in North campus delhi,"I have had lots of time to waste on finding PG near north campus DU, the PGs being too expensive, dirty, etc are usual ones but this one is one peculiar experiences  ......

&#x200B;

the owner( a Doctor on top of that) told me that his PG is in Roop nagar delhi which is one of the cleaner areas, so i called him standing in front of roop nagar police station, he kept directing me to his PG and i walked some odd 3 KMs and landed up in vijay nagar in the end.

&#x200B;

He ran an eye care clinic and the building adjacent to it was run down type that probably had Ghosts living it preparing for UPSC civil services,

&#x200B;

He told me that his hostel had churned out hundreds of IAS and army officers, the Doc talked in a sweat voice that it instantly put me on alert and defensive, he showed me a Room which was at max 4x4m and had three beds and these beds were custom made to have the width of a sofa, one curl at night and you fall down.

I, by this time, had decided that  i will not stay here even if he paid me to do it, but i wanted to see the thing play out as things were getting sillier by the second,

The best Part comes here, the main punchline of this write.....

He opened this tiny door which had a Toilet (1 x 1 m area), i, out of sheer curiosity asked how do people do laundry, he told me that outside service is there, i asked him how do people take Baths,

he, in a Poker serious face, exclaimed ""Are beta, vo hai to shower"" (look son, there is the shower), He pointed at the Random pipe fitted above the toilet, like almost above the Toilet, he made this Poker face that he did not knew the absurdity of the situation, like he was trying to make me believe

""Nhi beta, Delhi mei to aisa hi Hota hai, Mai, meri bacche, sab aise hi to krte hai, Tu hi small town ka chutiya hai jo paani waste krte ho""

&#x200B;

I was a bit amused at the situation, did i fuck off from there right there and then?

No, saw the 2 floors more and 13-15 rooms just to get more internal Laughs.",130,Non Political,"Flair_id    8f105a84-7ea0-11e3-bba1-12313b0c91be

828,SBI is very efficient now,"Yesterday I went to my SBI branch for re-kyc because they had deactivated my dormant account. All I had to do was follow these very short and simple steps:

1. Fill the kyc form, attach photo, aadhaar card and pan card copy
2. Go to service manager who will verify that the form has been filled correctly and stamp the form
3. Go to the kyc official, wait for her to come back from lunch, then she will enter the details in the system
4. Go back to service manager who will again verify that details have been entered correctly in the system and stamp the form again
5. Fill the cash withdrawal form to do a token withdrawal to reactivate the account (online withdrawal not allowed)
6. Go to the cash counter to submit the form, wait for him to come back from lunch, get his stamp
7. Take the form to the service manager. It's his turn to go for lunch now. Once he is back, he will again verify the form and stamp it again (I love how thorough they are)
8. Take the form back to the cash counter and finally get your hard earned cash.
9. Feel the immense sense of achievement and go home happy.

I was in and out of the branch within two hours, easy-peasy!

829,"Techies of r/india, please help me out","Okay, so I have long been a lurker, never created an account because never needed it. 

Now to the problem, I actually need advice about my career from you guys. If you have some time, read through my post and help me out, I would be immensely grateful. 

I have a Masters in Statistics, passed out this year and didn't put much effort in the masters degree because the course was mostly theory based and suited those who wanted to go for research. I wasn't, I wanted a job and found out that placement jobs were not well paid and also had very little to do with statistics, mostly data analyst jobs. So, I decided to try for a PSU job after passing out. Now, I worked my ass off in the 4 months after passing out and successfully reached the final stage of the PSU job, i.e, the interview and this is what wrecked my confidence. In short, they were rude, berated me for not using any social media, told they have no use of statistics and so on. In short, I know that option is gone. 

Now, I'm thinking I would get a 9-5 job that I can sustain myself with and on the side I would learn the Big data, AI and ML stuff and in a few years would completely switch to that field. I have some decent idea about the theory and the concepts because of my background but don't know how long will it take for me to learn the programming part. Mostly what I'm afraid of is whether this plan can also backfire on me? 

If you're an experienced person in this field, please help me out with your advice, I don't have anyone who I can go to for advice. Thank you in advance.

Also, if it's relevant, I did my masters from a fairly good university. Specially the stat dept. takes pride in being one of the best in India, although I beg to differ.",8,Non Political,"Flair_id    8f105a84-7ea0-11e3-bba1-12313b0c91be

1) Investment: what is the safest, long term investment that offers okay-ish returns? 
I'm trying to look for anything where we can put a part of our savings in, so it can generate some returns. But I don't want to invest it in stocks because the risk seems too high. Some options I've seen are a post office savings scheme, a national savings certificate, a KVP or mutual funds. Anything else? And what would be the best option?

2) Housing loan: what are the things I should be concerned with immediately? And is there a way to request a cooldown on the EMI's? The home loan wasn't insured. 

3) What are some claims that I should keep in mind where I could get some extra money from. I know about a covid death scheme that grants money. Are there any other ones?

So, as usual, we were going through all of our documents before leaving the house for the bank, and my father asked me to take his current address passbook because it might come in handy, so I was going through all of his passbooks when I came across one of his old 5-6 year passbooks, and out of curiosity, I simply checked the statements printed....

And what I saw really shattered my heart... All of the closing statements were less than 8000 - 9000rs......
All of the transactions were for less than 200 or 300 rupees, and they happened over the course of a month....

I started crying because I couldn't control my tears.

 I wasn't working 5 years ago, and I used to have arguments with him about ""why do you save so much?"" ""What's the point of this?"" 
For the record, I was never one to ask or force my parents to buy me anything, but they tried their best. Today, what I saw was enough to convince me why he was so serious about the financial aspect. I'm so glad he taught me good money management; now I understand why he always preferred to travel by bus rather than rickshaw or taxi... now I understand why we never went out to eat once a month... Everything seemed clear to me now.

Today, I work for a large corporation and earn a good living; my brother also earns good. We are now very well off, all because he made all of this possible with the little money he had.

My father doesn't have any bad habits, he is uneducated, so couldn't get a good income and my relatives sucked the blood and money out of him, but still he did what he can.

From today, I understood the true meaning of everything he said about life and money.

also, what sort of social expectations should i know about? the last thing i want to do is be impolite due to ignorance. for example, i learned quickly that a “thank you” can be seen as too formal/distant in india if you are family with the person you are thanking, whereas in the southern US, thanking everyone for anything, even family, is expected. how can i show my boyfriend’s family that i appreciate and respect them when i meet them?
i may be overthinking, but i just really want to make a good impression, especially since i am so ignorant with everything still. i am only beginning to learn hindi, and i’m terrible at it!

If people could easily marry outside their caste, then people wouldn't be so segregated in the first place. Also, caste is still a big deal because it's the most important factor in marriages, so marriaged couple of same caste will pass that mentality to the next generation.

I just find it surprising that such a casteist practice is seen as good thing by even progressive people in this sub.

While I don't live there anymore, I often lurk around this sub and watch Bollywood movies that remind me of home. One such movie is Imtiaz Ali's Rockstar. It reminds me of the winters in Delhi, the little nooks and corners of Delhi University. That movie is an absolute piece of art that never fails to make me cry. The worst addiction you can have is an addiction to another human being (Jordan and Heer's addiction to each other). That movie is full of passion, agony, pain, heartbreak, fury. When he screams his heart out in the song Sadda Haq, when he is thrown out of his home, when he finds refuge and love in a person he couldn't fully get, it brings a storm of emotions within me. Every song of that movie is a piece of art. When they hang out at Tughlaqabad Fort, it makes me miss India and brings a flashback of memories. Idk what it is, but that movie is so full of emotion. It's heartbreaking but a beauty.

862,I started a YouTube series for Tamil learners to help you read and write Tamil,"Hey guys,

A few months ago I started creating videos to teach Tamil. What I realised is that a *lot* of Tamil learners (and even native Tamil speakers!) wanted to learn to read and write Tamil, but couldn’t find the right resources. 

I, too, grew up speaking only English, and couldn’t read Tamil until I was well into my teen years. I struggled to learn but in my case, I had my parents to guide me. However, I know that this isn’t the case for everyone.

Because of this, I decided to start a YouTube series that teaches you to read and write Tamil *in an easy-to-understand way*. It’s very comprehensive and covers the differences between the English and Tamil scripts (hint: English has an alphabet while Tamil has an abugida, watch my video to find out what that means!), pronunciation, handwriting, and lots of example words, which means you will learn through context and exposure.

I hope you all find this helpful as I believe this is something the Tamil community has lacked for a long time. Please let me know your thoughts! Whether it's good or bad, anything I should change, what topics I should cover in future videos, etc. And if you're willing to chuck a like or subscribe, I’d greatly appreciate it!

867,Problem with being a rationalist on Indian social media,"With social medias (Twitter/Facebook/Reddit) being echo chambers with supporters firmly supporting their clan, it becomes very difficult to explain and maintain your position of rationality, especially when it comes to matter of religion.

Being born and grown in Hindu household and society, my ideology is shaped by the environment I grew up in. I consider myself Hindu and I will never abandon that. However, that is not my identity. I am a non-practicing Hindu. I don't go to temples, do not pray, do not observe any rituals and do not believe in god and I am not spiritual. And I celebrate and enjoy all Hindu festival (sans Holi), because of good food, music and chance to socialise. I enjoy listening to bhajans. qawalis and other religious songs purely for music and lyrics and the singer, as I get that ""divine"" feeling.

As I matured and moved out of India, I was impacted by a more liberal ideology. Now I think I was a proverbial frog in well when I was in Gujarat. I became more tolerant of different and opposing point of view, as I had to live and work in a highly multicultural environment. 

I read Dawkins and Hitchens, and that made me more passionate about rational thinking and vehemently opposed to the idea of organised religion and its dogma.

And there in lies the problem, especially when I interact in social media. They have become echo chambers of far-right or far-left groups, with each members devotedly adhering to its principles and fervently downvoting anyone with opposing views.

Thanks to consistent brainwashing by BJP IT cell, its devotees and its staunch opposers, Hinduism is now seen as an organised religion on social media with all 1+billion followers adhering to one ideology. RSS/BJP finally achieved its goal in labelling Hinduism as a monolithic religion, not as a group of people with different thinking living and inhabiting one big country. So on the Hinduism sub-reddit, you have people discussing passionately whether it is OK to pray while showering or whether I should eat meat on certain day (both a non-issue if you consider the ""way of life"" aspect of Hinduism). And on atheism sub-reddit, Hinduism is strictly considered as a Manuvadi religion, with the caste aspect thrown in your face as soon as you say something in favour of Hinduism. So you feel like an outcast on either of the sub-reddits.

And the issues doesn't stop here. Even when it comes to matter of secularism and religion, you become and outcast. As a rationalist, you know that religion is an irrational concept and hence society needs to evolve with time and discard old ideas. However, you run afoul with so-called liberals including feminists here. The current burning issue of hijab comes here. The whole  Indian social media liberal cabal would cry hoarse against evils of Hinduism, but remain silent or support Islam/Christianity - say for example the current hijab row. You will be labelled an Islamophobic as soon as you make a rational statement, that goes against the position held by a big chunk of Muslims and their supporters. And ironically, this double standard held by liberal political parties has been exploited cleverly by Modi and Inc. to their advantage to grow and spew hatred against Muslims.

I have been actively trying to wean myself of social media addiction, but has been difficult due to CoVid and other issues. Hopefully, decrease in Covid cases and onset of spring and summer will give me a chance to get out and meet real people and engage in some meaningful conversation.

879,"Why every solution related to parents is ""Move out""?","I really want to put it out there that whenever there is anything related to parents being assholes to their children, somebody outta nowhere will say ""mOvE oUT"" as if it is a piece of cake.

HEAR ME OUT: We are NOT living in the United States or the United Kingdom, where you can afford to move out even on the lowest wage. We're talking about INDIA here, and most people have no idea how parents are in chawls and slums, and their children are not as fortunate as you. They can't just wake up one day and move out because they don't have ""expensive"" degrees like you, they don't have ATLEAST educated parents who will not stoop to some shameful acts, and they don't have a ""well"" paying job because they didn't have expensive degrees. It's not that they didn't want to study and get a good job; it's just that they didn't have any opportunities because they are NOT from a well of family like YOU.  


My parents are narcissistic assholes, but I FIGHT BACK because I am one of the people I mentioned above, I am not RICH, nor are my parents, I went to a BMC school, and I live in the Mumbai slums, so I cannot ""JUST MOVE OUT."" I have a job, and it pays a puny 22k per month, but let me tell you, I have worked hard, REAL HARD, to get where I am now. I can't afford to leave.

881,First time solo trip,"Hi, I am 24 M, mostly introvert, from Uttarakhand, working in IT. I have never been on any trip either solo or with friends. Shocked!!! I know. I didn't have a very financially liberal childhood/college days. All I knew was to grind and get a good job which I did, but in the course of doing so, lost all the opportunities to make college memories (which I regret everyday). Even in job, I am just grinding everyday for past few years, not enjoying anything. Why? Because I have this fear embedded in me that I will become poor if i don't grind.

Anyways not going to bore you with my sad story. Coming to the topic, I have finally decided to take some time off from work i.e. from 2nd March - 11th March and I want to plan a 4-5 days solo trip. I am ready to go on one of those paid group trips(the one which has mostly unknown people). I want to enjoy some time, living freely away from all the tensions of career or money.

My preferences are: No trekking, no cold places. Budget - 10k(slightly variable)
Can you please help with follow queries:
1. What places would be a great travel experience?
2. Which trusted online website/ trip advisors should I use to book such group trips?
3. Any piece of advice for me who's a first time solo traveller, like how much money to carry, precautions to take, documents etc.

882,South Indian Cinema 101,"**NOTE : This post is taken from a reply I made to a thread on another post. Found it long and comprehensive enough to be standalone.**

**BIG DISCLAIMER (CAUSE PEOPLE ARE PISSED) : This post is extremely biased. I am from Kerala and my knowledge of the other industries (excluding Tamil) is limited to recent commercially successful movies that I've watched. I believe these movies do constitute the industry's image and this is why I have included them. It is my section on Malayalam cinema which is most accurate. Yet, when it do comes to the other ones, this post is better knowledge than nothing.**

Question, what is 'South Indian Cinema'? Madrasi? Telugu? No logic? Anti-gravity? Objectification of women? If you said 'yes' to any of these, either you are extremely influenced by stereotypes pushed by Bollywood/Media/Society or you're just watching the wrong movie. I'm a South Indian film buff (not just another film buff, like... FILM BUFF), and I must say, I have yet to encounter such a wild, and uncivilized piece of cinema as to be showcasing such devoidness of at least film-logic (logic MUST be bent to a certain extent for cinema to work) and physics. Any ones that do showcase such bending of physics and logic are either fantasy or hard sci-fi (and when I said 'fantasy' and 'sci-fi' if the thought that 'sci-fi? South india? wtf?' came across your mind, consider this not just an invitation to read the post, but a reminder to consider the rest 'essential education')

**NOTE 2 : I am South Indian, I eat Idlis and Sambar, I wear pieces of cloth that resemble skirts, I am dark, and yes, I am from a place known in antiquity as 'The Madras Presidency'. Yeh, all of that shit - So, I maybe a tad bit biased, do excuse... :)**

What follows is a concise introduction to South Indian cinema (excluding 70% of films made between 2000 and 2010, when the worst B-grade movies started to get dubbed into Hindi and other languages, and became the decade that stamped South Indian cinema as 'Illogical'. Sadly no one seems to know a dime about South Indian cinema pre-2000 or post-2010). Hope you'll enjoy it.

**BIGGER DISLAIMER : This post consists of the best aspects of each industry. I've watched plenty of trashy Telugu and Kannada movies, but it's the good ones that I have written about here. Also, my knowledge on the pre-2000 phase of these industries are very limited. Sahikkanam, ketto...**

**Telugu** \- Commercial entertainers, focused on actors portrayed as 'idealistic' and 'mass' heroes, who become idols and beacons of hope for men and women who just want their share of escape from their burdens and onto another world. For them, these heroes are what an ideal man should be, someone who has everything they don't (includes capability and availability of sexual release). Undoubtedly the most colourful industry of the lot, showcasing an idealistic world of music, celebration and pizzazz. Their films may come across as crappy and devoid of substance to some (included past me), but people should realize the audience they're made for. In Kerala, Telugu films are mainly watched by laborers, who after a long day's work, arrive at the film theatre to get lost in a world full of material pleasures unavailable to them (women, luxury, foreign countries). You can hear such workers talking about how they'll enjoy the night at the theatres. And if you're wondering, yes, this is a justification for such 'crappiness'. Such tropes have also seeped into the high-budget realm, enjoyed by people of all classes. The film industry is a great insight on how Andhra is changing. It's a rich state dominated by the IT sector, which is filled with people who've got no time for cinema. And quoting a Telugu friend, 'It's not the rich who decide a film's fate, it's the poor.'Film Recommendations : Bahubali series, Ala Vaikuntapuramuloo (Perfect embodiment of what Telugu cinema is all about, where you should just sit back and enjoy), Mahanati (Great insight into the early times of Indian cinema), Awe (Recommended a lot, yet to watch it), Eega (Weird, surreal, and good), Jathi Rathnalu (Comedy), Agent Sai Srinivasa Athreya (Thriller), Cinema Bandi (A loner on the arthouse side)

**Tamil** \- The most diverse industry I've seen.  You may think it's all that Telugesque colour and pizzaz, but while that exists, the Tamilians exhibit on one side the high-voltage gang thrillers of Pa. Ranjith, the grand science fiction of Shankar, the gritty neo-realism of Maniratnam, the cold, blood boiling lens of Vetrimaaran and so on. While entertainment and the actor's prestige, presence and personality do matter (a lot), the Tamil industry is focused on good stories, and it's the good stories that win.Film recommendations : Nayakan (One of the greatest films ever), Visaranai (Bone chilling and disturbing), Vikram Vedha (A great thriller, a fresh concept, and Vijay Sethupathi), Petta (great introduction to Thalapathy lore), Baasha (cult classic), Ratsasan (Horror-Thriller done right), 96 (A beautiful and depressing love story), Kaithi (A high voltage thriller, gripping), Enthiran (Grandiose Sci-Fi), Maanadu (Simultaneously masala and mind-bending sci-fi, how is this possible?)

Kannada: Extremely modern society, though ironically possessing an uncanny similarity to Telugu cinema. Sexual release and idol like hero worship were key. But as it shows in the society itself, the Kannada film industry becomes the most welcoming of new and fresh ideas in their space. Even though the old production kings still matter, it's young and inventive minds like Rakshit Shetty, Rishabh Shetty and Pawan Kumar that become the turnstile of their rapidly developing culture. Certainly very liberal, a place where both the old and time tested formulas of story and the inventive and experimental new-gen cinema can live together in peace.Film Recommendations : Kirik Party, Ulidavaru Kandanthe (Rakshit Shetty -> Indian Tarantino), Avane Srimannarayana (A proper Western), Bheemasena Nalamaharaja (A new and wholesome experience), KGF (This is what happens when you combine a great story with a great budget)

Malayalam: Undoubtedly a great summit for hardcore movie buffs. The cinema reflects the highly liberal, and secular society of Kerala. Societal issues are a huge theme. This is a place where filmmakers create cinema that points out the flaws of each religion, party, and person without any fear of being attacked. Movies like Trance, The Great Indian Kitchen and Kuruthi are next to impossible to be made in any other place. Extremely influenced by Italian neo-realism back in the 60s, the Malayalam film industry focuses on realistic stories and beautiful visual grammar. Their mastery over story and visual are uncomparable. Hosting some of the greatest actors the world has seen (Mohanlal, Mammootty, Fahad Faasil), hero worship is few to nil, and only someone with a great grasp over acting can reach the top, be it a veteran actor's son or a random boy next door... everyone has a chance. An industry where entertainment is not key, gripping and uncomfortable thrillers like Joji, Trance, Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum, Kumbalangi Nights and others hit the box office records.Film Recommendation : Joji (Unnerving adaptation of Macbeth), Trance (Brilliant piece on the flaws of Christianity, undoubtadly one of the best Indian movies ever made, an achievement in Indian cinematography), The Great Indian Kitchen ( '' '' on the flaws of Hindu society / Hindutva), Kuruthi ('' '' on the flaws of Islamic and Hindu extremism), Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum (Starts with a simple story about a necklace being stolen, and then turns insane), Kumbalangi Nights (A picturesque Kochi and a beautiful story of family and love), Drishyam (You prolly know this one), Premam (A film that is almost poem), Jallikattu (A perfect snapshot of human nature, madness, and animalistic behaviour), Ee.Ma.Yau (A meditative essay on death), Kurup (Brilliant film on the life of the famous criminal), Churuli (A weird, absurd, time travel / Alien abduction film, really (like REALLY) ahead of its time), 9 (Another alien abduction movie), Ayyappanum Koshiyum (When two like forces decide to oppose), Minnal Murali (Just released, First good superhero film of India)

If you're a normal Indian, may this be an insight into the inventive and fresh world of South Indian cinema, and if you're a film buff (just go watch all of em). Thanks for reading.",284,Culture & Heritage ,"Flair_id    a068b548-1d08-11eb-a34c-0e38cd15065f

893,Hinduism and meat eating myth,"There has been this misconception going around for quite some time that

Eating meat is prohibited in Hinduism OR a brahman never eats meat OR Hinduism promotes vegetarian diet OR the one who eats meat is not a true Hindu

I found out that the reality is very different

\> In Mahabharatha it is mentioned that Yudhishtira fed the brahmanas meat before entering the palace of Indraprastha \[1\]

\> There are instances in Valmiki Ramayan where Lord Ram himself not only offered meat in a prayer \[2\] , but offered meat to Goddess Sita as well \[3\]. Even King Vali mentions that eating meat of 5-nailed animals is permitted to Brahmins and Kshatryas \[4\].

\> Many Hindu religious scriptures mentions the conditions where meat can be consumed, and SHOULD BE consumed by a Brahmin \[5\].

\> Even Bhagwad Gita does not explicitly classify meat/flesh as Satvik or Rajsik or Tamsik \[6\]. Only humans do.

\> Though some religious scriptures mentions that a Brahmin should avoid meat unless it is offered in a religious ceremony \[7\].

Dekho bhai, being a vegetarian is someone's personal choice. I respect that. But ye bolna ki ""meat eating is against Hinduism"" or ""it is discouraged/frowned upon in Hinduism"" is factually wrong.

Some men in animal furs were attacking a much better equiped Army, which was commanded by a man with a magnificent moustache. His soldiers formed a wall with their shields, and then he ordered some (i think) torsion weapons to fire javelines at the Attackers. After the first strike they used catapults to throw two metal balls, which were connected with a large cloth, at the Furry-Guys. The metal balls only did marginal damage, but then they repeated the attack, but this time the cloth was lit on fire, which was considerably worse.

906,New found admiration for South India,"I recently visited Ooty and Coonoor in Tamil Nadu and as someone who was visiting the Southern part of India for the first time, I was a bit apprehensive about how the trip will go especially since I was with my fiance. But the hospitality and warmth that I experienced in both the towns was really wonderful. Despite not knowing a single word of Tamil, we could easily converse with all the locals in English and to my surprise even in Hindi. As someone born and brought up in Delhi and who has been working in Mumbai for the better part of 5 years, this level of hospitality really came as a pleasant surprise to me as initially I had imagined people would be slightly conservative and not too receptive towards North Indians. People were as polite as I have seen anywhere and we never felt unsafe to roam around streets even during the night. Moreover, I was astounded by the level of cleanliness in the Nilgiris especially compared to Hill stations in the North.
Apologies if I came across as a culturally ignorant in this post but this trip really changed a lot of perceptions I had about South Indians. Would love to  explore and even work/live there if I got an opportunity.",252,Culture & Heritage ,"Flair_id    a068b548-1d08-11eb-a34c-0e38cd15065f

910,"The great Indian Parenting, beating helpless children black and blue.","I just saw a post on reddit where a dad was beating his daughter black and blue because she chatted on instagram. I had something similar to share. I wrote this as a comment but thought this can be a good place for all of us to admit and share similar incidents. I encourage you all to share your stories from the attic. We can help each other overcome child abuse.

Trigger Warning. This is a my story from about a decade ago. I'm 20 today.

Remember that time when having charging point near your bed was'nt a norm? There were Nokia phones back then. Slowly, the cables started getting smaller. To the point that my dad had to position charger in a very specific way to just get his phone on some surface without falling. The charger brick always had to be plugged in upright down, so that the charing cable comes from left, giving us a few precious centimetres to get the mobile just on the platform.

One fine day, I removed the charger, just for a few minutes. And then plugged it back in, however, this time upright, instead of upright down. Unknown behest to me, my dad came home in evening and tried plugging his phone in. It didn't stay on the platform because obviously the charger was plugged in the supposed wrong way. He called me in, and asked about it. For a few seconds, I \*genuinely\* forgot that I had unplugged the charger. I replied that I didn't know about it. He asked my brother. He also relayed a negative. And then it struck me that it was me. Oblivious to what would happen if I admit my mistake, I just said, ever so nonchalantly, ""Are ha Pappa, mich kadhle hote dupari."". That is, I said yes I just remembered that I had took it out in the noon.

Just as I turned behind to do something, suddenly, he sprung into action and removed his leather belt from his pant, within seconds, he was throwing in lashes with all his force. He was drunk at the moment. Perhaps a bit too much to even differentiate his child from a animal. Even animals get treated better than this. He kicked me several times. I started bleeding from my mouth when I hit a wall. My whole body had belt scars that ran atleast 4 to 7 mm deep. My body hurt like hell. I had fever for next 3 days.

To this day, I am tramatised of the incident. I can never have my doors open left open. I'm still scared if someone will come and hit me from my back. I still struggle to get a polite night's sleep. 

All for what? Because I plugged a charger the wrong way.",423,Culture & Heritage ,"Flair_id    a068b548-1d08-11eb-a34c-0e38cd15065f

915,I have a question about gender roles in India.,"Hi guys, I have a question about gender roles in India.

Before asking the question, I want to let you know that I respect the difference between the culture in India and other countries. 

 Not every culture has the same figures, and the idealistic image of one country can be seen as chaotic from the view from outside.

 It does not mean that the culture is flawed, it's just the way it is because it has been the way it is. I have no intention to judge and make it a debate regarding Feminism.  

&#x200B;

So.......yea, I will keep it simple and summarize the long story as short as possible. 

&#x200B;

There's a guy I have been talking with. We are getting to know each other, and there's this butterflied feeling going on between us, it's very mutual and going well. 

We have lots of common ground when it comes to life. However, it seems like he has certain expectations toward his future wife. 

&#x200B;

He wants a wife who cooks for him every day, he wants his wife to take care of babies while the husband earns the money. I respect him, I understand where he is coming from, and I am open to the idea of talking it through if he is open-minded enough, but, even though our perspectives share some amount of common ground, for me, being a traditional housewife is not even an option. Because I know I will live a miserable life if I had to. I am scared if the feeling I have for him has to be ended because of the different views we have toward gender roles. 

&#x200B;

I am about to enroll in a medicine program, and I have these specific plans for the next 10 years. 

Also, I am a very goal-oriented person. If I ever get married in the future, I want my husband to be as responsible as me with the housework. I want him to respect my career. 

&#x200B;

927,I started a YouTube channel for Tamil learners due to the lack of good resources available for Tamil,"Hey guys,

As the title states, I created a YouTube channel to help you learn Tamil. There aren't that many good resources out there for Tamil learners, and that's what inspired me to start making videos.

I'm a diaspora Tamil myself, but when I was growing up my parents only spoke English to me. I always felt that I'd lost a part of my culture by not being able to speak Tamil.

When I was 20 I decided to teach myself Tamil, and I'm now pretty decent. There weren't that many resources - let alone resources targeted for English speakers - but through a lot of effort and through harassing my friends and family for help I managed to find my way.

I learned a lot along the way that I think will be helpful for English speakers looking to learn Tamil. This is the channel I wish existed when I was learning Tamil.

Please let me know your thoughts! Whether it's good or bad, anything I should change, what topics I should cover in future videos, etc. And if you're willing to chuck a like or subscribe, would greatly appreciate it!

Although rape isn't legally allowed, it's a fact that a woman likes a man who is very expert at rape""—His Divine Grace Bhaktivedanta Swami /s Prabhupada, Srimad Bhagavatam 4.25.41

'Hitler was a Great Aryan Hero. A humane gentleman. Jews were financing against Germany, otherwise he'd no enmity with them. They want interest money--therefore Hitler decided ""Kill all the Jews""'

Edit: One More from a comment below, calling for Child Marriage:

""It is therefore the duty of the father to get his daughter married before she attains puberty....It is a psychological fact that when a woman at the age of puberty meets a man and the man satisfies her sexually, she will love that man for the rest of her life, regardless who he is. Thus so-called love within this material world is nothing but sexual satisfaction.""

EDIT 1: But wait there's more. This bigot doesn't like women secretaries:

> Srila Prabhupada was very clear on this issue, he called women secretaries a bad habit. Here is a quote:

> In the name of religion you do all nonsense rascaldom, and if the leader approves, “Yes, you can do.” Vivekananda did it. Vivekananda did it. “Yes, there is no difference between eating meat and not meating eat in terms of religious system.” He preached this, and all the sannyāsīs of Ramakrishna Mission, they eat meat, they drink, they have WOMAN SECRETARY, and everything. This Chinmayananda also like that. I know his whole history. Unless one is purely Kṛṣṇa conscious, one cannot give up ALL THESE BAD HABITS. This is the test.

954,Raghunath Nayak - An underrated Hero,"74 years ago TODAY, Godse killed an unarmed old man at point-blank range, tried to escape, and was tackled & pinned down by the gardener of Birla house.

Today is the day when Independent India's first terrorist murdered Gandhi, who did the cowardly act because of his bigotry.

Raghunath Nayak from Odisha worked as a gardener at Birla House in New Delhi and, on January 30, 1948, he chased Nathuram Godse after he shot Mahatma Gandhi. 

Nayak grappled with Godse and pinned him down, till the police arrested him.

Raghunath Nayak is an underrated Hero.

He chased, wrestled and pinned down Godse (who had a revolver). If Godse had escaped, then an unknown assassin would have created rumours and would have resulted in more deaths in a newly Independent India.

The spectacle of what is called religion, or at any rate organised religion, in India and elsewhere, has filled me with horror and I have frequently condemned it and wished to make a clean sweep of it. Almost always it seemed to stand for blind belief and reaction, dogma and bigotry, superstition, exploitation and the preservation of vested interests.

975,Sharing a piece of Dr. Ambedkar's writing in context of ongoing Hijab row,"I came across a 2018 tweet by Ramchandra Guha (link in comment) quoting Dr. Ambedkar's views on the Burqa practice. It involves a remark by Dr. Ambedkar calling the sight of Burqa-clad women as ""hideous"". So I accessed and read the relevant portion from his book which is really enlightening and thought-provoking. Thus, I am sharing the relevant piece of his writing here.

Dr. Ambedkar writes:

""As a consequence of the  purdah  system a segragation of the Muslim women is brought about. The ladies are not expected to visit the outer rooms, verandahs or gardens, their quarters are in the back-yard. All of them, young and old, are confined in the same room. No male servant can work in their presence. A woman is allowed to see only her sons, brothers, father, uncles and  husband, or any other near relation who may be  admitted  to  a  position  of  trust.  She  cannot  go  even to the mosque to pray and must wear  burka  (veil) whenever she has to go out. These  burka  women walking in the streets is one of the most hideous sights one can witness in India. Such seclusion cannot but have its deteriorating effects upon the physical constitution of Muslim women. They are usually victims to anaemia, tuberculosis and pyorrhoea. Their bodies are  deformed,  with  their  backs  bent,  bones  protruded,  hands and feet crooked. Ribs, joints and nearly all their bones ache. Heart palpitation is very often present in them. The result of this pelvic deformity is untimely death at the time of  delivery.  Purdah  deprives  Muslim  women  of  mental  and moral nourishment. Being deprived of healthy social life, the process of moral degeneration must and does set in. Being completely secluded from the outer world, they engage their minds in petty family quarrels with the result that they become narrow and restricted in their outlook. They lag behind their sisters from other communities, cannot take part in any outdoor activity and are weighed down by a slavish mentality and an inferiority complex. They have no desire for knowledge, because they are taught not to be  interested  in  anything outside  the  four  walls  of  the  house. Purdah  women in particular become helpless, timid, and unfit for  any  fight in life.  Considering the  large  number  of  purdah women among Muslims in India, one can easily understand the vastness and seriousness of the problem of  purdah""

978,Sahir and Amrita: Unrequited Love,"[Sahir Ludhianavi](https://rekhta.org/poets/sahir-ludhianvi) was a hopeless romantic and was as passionate about life as he was about love. He was known for his fondness for falling in love with women time and again, but he couldn't possibly overcome his commitment issues. Despite all this, he fell for one particular woman rather passionately. The woman was the celebrated poetess, [Amrita Pritam](https://rekhta.org/authors/amrita-pritam). Their love story is known to have a cliched beginning of ""love at first sight"" at a mushaira in Preet Nagar. Their love unfurled through letters; their words created a bridge of love, trust and affection.  
   
On one hand, Amrita was ready to walk out of her unhappy marriage. On the other hand, Sahir didn't seem so sure of himself and the future they may have had. Although Sahir never committed to her, he always loved her so passionately that he kept the dirty cup of tea that was used by his beloved Amrita Pritam the last time she visited him. He even mentioned her to his mother in a conversation, saying, ""yeh Amrita thi, janti ho na?"" Yeh aapki bahu bhi bann sakti thi""  
   
His unfulfilled love story with Amrita inspired him to verses some very beautiful lines like, ""Mehfil se uth jaane waalo."" It is said that the song was inspired by their last meeting, which was quite poignant, and while parting with Amrita, Sahir poetically said, ""Tum chali jaaogi, parchhaiyan reh jaayengi/kuchh Ishq ki Raanaaiyaan rah jaayengi"" (when you leave, your lovely silhouettes shall remain/Memories of love will smart me time and again).  
   
They separated but couldn't forget each other. Their love remained unrequited, unfulfilled, and, unlike the cliched beginning, they didn't get to have a cliched happy ending. But their love story will continue to tell tales of love and longing for decades to come.",14,History ,"Flair_id    b296e92e-1d08-11eb-a7ed-0edd7560b1c3

984,Gobekli Tepe site is 12000 yrs old. Oldest civilization in world comes from Middle East.,"9000 years older than the Mesopotamian civilization, Gobekli Tepe is standing landmark and an unanswered question that makes it the cradle of modern human civilization in terms of collective society and organized work effort. 

Even the claims of major archaeologists and propagandists fall face down with the behemoth of physical evidence found at this site which might be the precursor of Sumerians, Abrahamic, Vedic, and Mayan cultures. 

Gobekli Tepe is a site that seriously undermines modern day archaeology interpretations of human civilizational progression and the associated political propaganda that stens from it. 

You can read more about Gobekli Tepe here. 

[UNESCO - GOBEKLI TEPE](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1572/)


Edit : How it relates to India? 

The temple site at Gobekli Tepe has been found to contain detail carvings of birds, animals and reptilians which are predominantly found in the warm tropic regions of Asia. The presence of such animals on a shrine site is closely aligned with tribal ritualistic beliefs of India where various animals were worshipped as dieties. Also, in many temples in India, and cave carvings similar stonework of animal worship is found. These could've been very well a part of a global shamanistic culture. Remember this is all pre-vedic in culture and more aligned with Animism. Animism in India was slowly absorbed into the Hindu faith system and now is indistinguishable but when compared with archaeological evidences one can see its antiquity is much older than the vedic period. Even the Indus Valley culture practiced some upgraded form of Animism which is evident from the recovered seal at Harrappa. 

Read this piece here on India's Animistic Polythiesm [India's Animistic Polythiesm](https://aingsword.wordpress.com/essays/hm-part-1-eap/)

So coming back. The findings of Gobekli Tepe in its root might have the answer to first form of ancient culture development and faith system, which seems like was Animism and is most widely practiced in India and many other places, and may very well be the progenitor of all derivative civilizations of the world like egyptian, mayan, indus valley, mesopotamian etc. 

If a DNA sample is ever found at Gobekli Tepe, the world's and many other nations like India can trace their ancestoral antiquity to it. From the markings at the temple site it seems we are already there.",4,History ,"Flair_id    b296e92e-1d08-11eb-a7ed-0edd7560b1c3

However, I'm unsure if the book by Doniger would be a good choice since it seems to have a lot of Western leftist bias.

Basham seems better though considering it's over 60 years old, I can't help but wonder if it's a bit out of date and has been superseded by contemporary scholarship.

I wonder why there are so many indians who say that the british rule in india was the worst, while praising the Mogul empire? Not trying to downplay anything, but in comparsion there is quite a difference.  
The worst we can say about the british is that everything they did (even the positive things like building infrastructure, administration and fighting groups like the Thuge) was done for smoothly keeping the profit coming, while it looks like the Mogul empire went far out of its way to make the hindus etc. feel misserable, and hopefully convert to islam, and while their profit stayed in india it was mostly used for ""Bling"" like lavish palaces.

1018,Why are large numbers so common in Indian mythology?,"Hi all, crossed post from r/Askhistorians.

I have little background knowledge but it seems like exact and exaggerated number is a unique characteristic of Indian mythology.

For example, a day of Brahma is equivalent to 4.32 billion human years. King Sagara had 60 thousand sons and a hundred sons are not uncommon. There were 1.66 billion men fallen in the Kurukshetra War. And the deities tend to have many arms and heads. Things like these.

I mean other mythologies also have exaggerated descriptions like “xxx the whole world / sky / Olympus” but they are exaggerated at a lower extent. And when a specific number is provided, like saying a flood covered from 40 days to about a decade, it tends to be historically true to some extent. And for “large number”, a thousand years are long enough.

So is it true that large number is a distinct trait of Indian mythology? Why? Does it come from the idea that the world is a huge simulation generated and maintained and regenerated by some supreme entity or something like that, like the Panentheism Krishna talked about in the Gita? Because Indians somehow like the idea that there’s something really great, they use huge numbers here and there to illustrate the greatness? If it’s the case, how the generated reality idea comes out in the first place? Creation is common thing but the Indian idea looks like a different view.

I apologize if I misunderstand something but I’m generally curious.",5,History ,"Flair_id    b296e92e-1d08-11eb-a7ed-0edd7560b1c3

It was an era when education was reserved only for upper-caste males & female educators were unheard of.

I came across an interesting story about Jawaharlal Nehru told to me by one of the village leaders. Once in the 1950's Nehru came to inaugurate the dam known as Barapani or Umiam. It seems that on his was back, his convoy was flagged down by the villagers of a little village along the highway. The local headman demanded that Nehru see him. Seems Nehru obliged the man. The man demanded Nehru build his village a school for there was none to be found anywhere nearby. This headman wanted his people to learn to read and write and grow and become more than villagers farming for a living.


Nehru was in turn so moved by this man, it seems he ordered his underlings to build this school and within a few years a school was built and the school bore Nehru's name though he never again returned to that village.

1023,Rebel Sultans,"When it comes to Indian history, the Deccan doesn't get its fair share of attention despite being the birthplace of some pretty interesting ideas and developments. But when it comes to history, it is only remembered as the birthplace of the Maratha Confederacy and the battlefield where the Mughals and Marathas duked it out. This book covers the lesser known history of the region, from Alauddin Khilji's first raid in 1296 to Alamgir's conquest of the last Deccan sultanate in 1687.

 It was in the Deccan that an Indian sultan decided not to levy the military-exemption tax (jizya) from non-Muslims, generations before Shahehshah Akbar. It was in the Deccan that gunpowder weapons were first employed on the Indian battlefield, almost a century before Badshah Babur used them to vanquish the Afghans and Rajputs.

Medieval history has fallen victim to the idea of 'us' vs 'them' in popular conscience. This pop history book is an attempt to fix that; it shows that religious pluralism and syncretism wasn't just limited to the Mughal court in the Persianate Age. There was incredible tolerance in the Deccan courts for 'the other'. From sultans who proclaimed themselves to be the sons of Hindu deities to rayas who kept prominently displayed qurans in their throne rooms, the pre-Mughal Deccan was a melting pot; one that deserves more attention.

Rebel Sultans tells you the history of medieval Deccan in a way that is entertaining and easy to grasp, without oversimplifying it. Even if you'd like to read more academic texts, this book is a great starting point for you. I'm adding the link to an Indian website you can buy the book from. If you can't buy the book and would still like to read it, DM me. But please, buy the book if you can and support the author.

1031,Why Bhagat Singh was an Atheist?,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2907k4l1csc81.png?width=1410&format=png&auto=webp&s=a50362c53c958dbeea5744fe9b1887bbc30ad583

  

When faced with a series of setbacks, one's hope wanes and one loses enthusiasm in pursuing action. A person's despair and melancholy can be exacerbated by repeated defeat. Can we envision a young man working on a chapter of a book while awaiting his execution in a matter of hours?

This was an example of a remarkable Indian revolutionary's character, wit, courage, and power. It is surprising that he was still interested in pursuing his hobby of reading a book even on the last day before his hanging. One and only one such extraordinary incident occurred in India. This incident pertains to one of India's greatest freedom fighter, Sardar Bhagat Singh.

The young man who wilfully chose death and was hung by the British government at the age of 21. He asked the British government to shoot him instead of hanging him since he considered himself to be a freedom warrior and revolutionary. His demand, however, was denied. Sardar Bhagat Singh's bravery at the age of 21 is unparalleled in history.

Will our country ever see this type of youth again? Our nation is commemorating Republic Day. Simply participating in the Flag March at India Gate is insufficient. Youth should be reminded of the long freedom battle in which many Indian youth participated at the time.

In fact, Republic Day serves as a reminder of those who have given their lives to make this goal a reality. It is because of their sacrifices that we have this freedom. Among the many independence warriors, the name of Sardar Bhagat Singh is held in high regard. 

These sacrifices should be reminded in the mind of Indian young population in order to enable them to comprehend the price of our independence. Sardar Bhagat Singh's storey is one of those enthralling tales that may inspire any Indian kid.

Sardar Bhagat Singh is regarded as one of India's Great Revolutionaries, having played a crucial part in the country's war for independence. Many rebels played crucial roles in the war for Indian independence. Among all of these rebels, Sardar Bhagat Singh's personality stands out. Readers will be startled to learn that Sardar Bhagat Singh survived only 21 till years.

From the outset, he saw his family members struggle against the British government's atrocities. His uncle continued to struggle against the injustice against Indians. Sardar Bhagat Singh was troubled by the plight of the oppressed from the start. Bhagat Singh has never believed in the presence of a merciful God.

Bhagat Singh's faith was severely shaken after seeing the Britishers' atrocities against the poor and weak Indians. He couldn't think God could be kind while yet allowing the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre to take place. 

The brutal attack by British Police against Indian freedom fighter Shri Lala Lajpat Roy on 17.11.1928 sparked the fire in him that led him to become a revolutionary. As a result of a lathicharge carried out on him by Britishers in Lahore, Lala Lajpat Roy died. Sardar Bhagat Singh chose the path of violence to avenge the brutal murder of Lala Lajpat Roy. 

Later, he decided to kill Deputy Inspector General Scott, who had been responsible for Lala Lajpat Roy's death, but he killed Assistant Superintendent Saunders instead. After that he dramatically escaped from Lahore to Calcutta after killing Assistant Superintendent Saunders and reached Agra where he was instrumental in establishing bomb factory. 

Bhagat Singh cast considerable doubt on God's existence.He was an outspoken atheist who remained so till the end of his days. Bhagat Singh was a firm non believer in the presence of God. People's pain and misery shook his trust in God. He also wrote an article that was published after he passed away. WHY I AM AN ATHEIST was the title of the piece. 

The following are key portions from that essay, penned by Sardar Bhagat Singh in his said article. Bhagat Singh , being atheist asked questions to the follower of God in following manner.

” 1. If, as you believe there is an Almighty, Omnipresent, Omniscient God, who created the earth or universe, please let me know, first of all, as to why he created this world. This world which is full of woe and grief, and countless miseries, where not even one person lives in peace. 

2. Pray, don’t say it is His law. If He is bound by any law, He is not Omnipotent. Don’t say it is His pleasure. Nero burnt one Rome. He killed a very limited number of people. He caused only a few tragedies, all for his morbid enjoyment. But what is his place in history? By what names do we remember him? All the disparaging epithets are hurled at him. Pages are blackened with invective diatribes condemning Nero: the tyrant, the heartless, the wicked. 

3.One Genghis Khan killed a few thousand people to seek pleasure in it and we hate the very name. Now, how will you justify your all powerful, eternal Nero, who every day, every moment continues his pastime of killing people? How can you support his doings which surpass those of Genghis Khan in cruelty and in misery inflicted upon people? I ask why the Almighty created this world which is nothing but a living hell, a place of constant and bitter unrest. Why did he create man when he had the power not to do so? Have you any answer to these questions?

4.You will say that it is to reward the sufferer and punish the evildoer in the hereafter. Well, well, how far will you justify a man who first of all inflicts injuries on your body and then applies soft and soothing ointment on them? How far the supporters and organizers of Gladiator bouts were justified in throwing men before half starved lions, later to be cared for and looked after well if they escaped this horrible death. That is why I ask: Was the creation of man intended to derive this kind of pleasure?""

One thing was certain: Bhagat Singh was adamant in his beliefs. This is significant since he had an extremely short life span. He died while he was only 23 years old. He harbored severe doubts regarding God's existence. 

Another aspect is that he was unable to obtain the correct response. He was unable to find the right Spiritual Guru. He would have reached the pinnacle in spiritual field also if he had met a great spiritual Guru and received proper guidance.

Perhaps he was not lucky enough to cherish the destiny of an Indian rebel named Aurovindo Ghosh, who was a revolutionary in his younger years but subsequently became one of India's finest saints and established in devotion to Lord Krishna. Sardar Bhagat Singh was, and was, an atheist revolutionary throughout his life, but was certainly having all the basic qualities to tread on the path spiritual peak.

It is because a person has to believe firmly in his ideology to attain spiritual height. Then one can defeat nature's laws. It is imperative to be able to transcend bodily desire. In a sense, Bhagat Singh fulfilled this requirement.

He also threw a bomb in the then Central Assembly Hall to protest the British Government's Trade disputes bills. It was done only to register protest against the implementation of unreasonable laws. During that incident, no one was injured. Even though he had enough time to escape, he instead got himself arrested and sent to jail.

In 1929, in protest of differential treatment of Indian prisoners, he began his fast in jail, which lasted for 116 days. The number of fasting days that he completed exceeded those done by any revolutionary before him. Asceticism is based on conquering the human appetite, which is a prerequisite to treading this path and of course he was one of the most man for this path.

This facet of Bhagat Singh's life should not be overlooked: he was quite honest and serious in what he thought, believed, and did. He was adamant in his beliefs.

Sardar Bhagat Singh denied the existence of God throughout his life. He used to criticize God for the impoverished and downtrodden ordinary man's misery. Even on his dying day, when he was hanged, he remained staunch in his convictions.

Karl Marx's philosophy was a subject that piqued his curiosity. He used to read Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin's works. His vision of India was a country in which no one was separated based on caste or creed.

Bhagat Singh was a vocal opponent of Hindu society's Caste System. He loudly chastised Indian leader Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya for accepting a sweeper's garland and then attempted to cleanse himself with Ganga Water. Any such practises were frowned upon by him.

Despite the fact that his strategy of achieving independence differed from Mahatma Gandhi's nonviolent approach. Both Sardar Bhagat Singh and Mahatma Gandhi, on the other hand, aspired to better the plight of India's untouchables.

Even until his death, his determination to restore social peace to India's many classes and castes remained unwavering.

There was a Muslim Sweeper named Bhoga in Lahore Central Jail when he was about to be executed. Bhoga belonged to the lower caste, whereas Bhagat Singh belonged to the upper caste.

Bhagat Singh referred to him as Bebe (the mother). According to Bhagat Singh, Bhoga used to clean the jail in the same way that a mother cleans a baby's body. That is why Bhagat Singh referred to Bhoga as Bebe (the mother).

Bhagat Singh yearned to eat Bhoga's Roti (bread) in the latter days of his life. Though Bhoga was apprehensive to give Bhagat Singh the meal he made, he did so after Bhagat Singh's repeated requests.

Whatever thoughts Bhagat Singh cultivated in his mind, he carried out in his life. He not only wished for India to be a casteless society, but he also led by example. On the one hand, when one of the Greats, Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, failed to overcome his conditioning, Bhagat Singh was successful.

The hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru is commemorated as Martyrdom Day every year on March 23. On the night of March 23, 1931, these three sons of the country were hung in Lahore's Central Jail.

Senior prison warden Chhattar Singh urged that Sardar Bhagat Singh sing the praises of God on the day he was to be executed. However, Bhagat Singh disputed this, saying that if he took the name of God on the final day of his life, ""they would assume that I was terrified.""

When Jail Warden Chhattar Singh arrived to take Bhagat Singh to be executed, he was reading a book about Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin. When Chhattar Singh arrived , while reading the book, Bhagat Singh stated, ""WAIT A MINUTE, ONE REBEL IS MEETING THE OTHER.""

In fact, Bhagat Singh was a big fan of Lenin's and Carl Marks' works. Lenin was also a revolutionary. On the last day of his life, Bhagat Singh could barely resist the desire to imbibe the thoughts of another revolutionary named Lenin. In this context, he sought Chhattar Singh for permission to read the views of another revolutionary.

The heroism and character displayed by Bhagat Singh are not mentioned anywhere else. He was just 21 years old when he had the ambition to finish his book just hours before he was to be hanged.

What a character, what a height of conviction in one’s belief , what a confidence, what a courage Bhagat Singh embodied. Words cannot adequately depict Bhagat Singh's personality. Actually, he was one of the few people in the world about whom no distinction could be made between his words and deeds.

While celebrating Republic Day, our kids must draw inspiration from the life of this remarkable youth, who not only cultivated extraordinary thoughts and courage, but also practised in his life, even to the end.

We see numerous incidents of mental breakdowns as a result of failures in today's environment. Students are becoming depressed as a result of little concerns. On this Republic Day, they must be reminded of Bhagat Singh's incident. Indian youth must be inspired by Bhagat Singh's life. The life of Bhagat Singh is enough to inspire and drive Indian young. 

Let the courage, power, and resolve of Bhagat Singh be ingrained in the minds of Indian teenagers and children on this auspicious day of Republic Day celebration.

This kindled the curiosity in me to see how many people here self-identify as rich. I am totally aware that this is unscientific, and the definitions of ""rich"" and ""poor"" are not set in stone.

I wanted to have a poll with only two options - rich and poor. If you're not poor, you are rich. If you identify as the so called ""middle class"" (which I do, and I am), you are rich.

1049,Please help. Father in critical state.,"I’ve Originally posted this in /Lucknow subreddit. Although I am in need of financial assistance now.

Feb 2nd, after a long restless night of my father being awake, I admitted My father(71) in a nearby  hospital after a reaction from his tuberculosis medication (day 2). Turned out he went into hypoglycaemia aka very low sugar, went unconscious.They infused him with sugar and he came back to senses. During evening he had a major seizure episode. We shifted him to midland hospital and he is here since then. 

Situation : I am 26, came back to Lucknow on September, after hearing the news of my mother passing away. Dad suffered a femur fracture 14 days later. I am the only one looking after him since, along with the past 8 days running around in the hospital for tests and buying medicines. Haven’t showered , have been eating food from canteen. Calling Relatives from different cities is redundant. People in my society where I live visit every other day but stay only for few hours.

Dad felt better on 4th, was shifted to private ward. On 6th got his colonoscopy done. Situation got worse and now he’s back in ICU. Current treating Neuro is Dr Anupam Jaiswal here. today even one of the resident doctor yelled at me bc I greeted the senior doctor who told me to wait outside and he’ll come out to talk to me talk to me, calling me over smart etc 

Other people here see me running around and help me with food etc. recommend me some senior doctor to get in touch with. My fathers condition is detoriating, took several second opinions wherever I could get one. I don’t even know why I am writing this post and what help I need because I’ve never experienced this in my life before. Anyone here who can show me some form of guidance or assistance in ways I don’t know that exist. Maybe that could be of some use.

My thoughts are all over the place while I write this, i don’t if this post will help at all but I feel helpless and alone and I don’t know what to do or whom to reach out to.

It has been roughly 20 days since he is in the hospital. I am currently unemployed and my fathers insurance policy has been utilised earlier for his femur fracture. Looking for a fundraiser and advice on how to create one. I can provide all relevant documents as well, attaching the most recent case summary here.

Medical documents : https://imgur.com/a/ZAEZFMt
Medial Documents (watermarked): https://imgur.com/a/Tp9vsxM


Or please let me know if there is a separate website to create fundraising.

Update : Shifted him to private ward yesterday. He has been hyperactive and talks too loud. Aggressive and grumpy behaviour. Psychiatrist showed up and has prescribed medication “Rispond”. 
Has started to eat orally. Will update tomorrow about his condition whether there are any improvements.

Doctors haven’t updated yet on his lung infection so I’ll talk to them about that too. Neurologically he has had no seizures in the past couple of days but has odd behaviour as I mentioned earlier",1236,AskIndia,"Flair_id    0c1b1aea-3166-11e5-aaec-0ef63926eacd

1053,Why do Indian parents (not all) hate love marriages?,"My parents say that it's against our culture and no one has done it before in our family so can't I. I mean WTH is this logic. And another reason my parents give is what our relatives will think of us if I do a love marriage coz I'm marrying a girl who is not chosen by them. Why do relatives have to interfere in everyone's personal choices like marriage? let the person who is getting married decide whom he/she wants to marry after all he/she is the one who is going to spend the rest of their life with them. I get it, relatives, want our best but they should not cross their boundaries. 

My mom's friend's daughter is going to marry her boyfriend(intercast), while talking about it with me my mom said that ""usne apne maa-baap ka sar zukane wala kam kyu kia"". Her parents were against this marriage coz their relatives were not happy with it. After so many quarrels they finally agreed to this marriage. My point here is many people(including my own mom) consider love marriage as a crime.

Many parents say no to love marriage coz they think the divorce rate in love marriages is more. But they ignore the fact that chances of domestic violence are more in an arranged marriage. I'm not saying that arranged marriages are bad, they surely can turn out to be great like my parents and many others but my point is if someone wants to do a love marriage their parents or relatives should not deny or force them for an arranged marriage.

Sorry, it turned into a rant, I'm frustrated by this mindset of people. What's your opinion on this? Why do you think Indian parents hate love marriage?",137,AskIndia,"Flair_id    0c1b1aea-3166-11e5-aaec-0ef63926eacd

1056,Why does most of the stand-ups in India by female comedians revolve only around them being 'female'?,"Sometimes it feels like that not just in standup but the whole female content space in India. Recently, I made a switch to watch content/comedy from other random countries & it seems like they really have some variety; each comedian & creator irrespective of gender bringing something unique that feels like they really have put effort into the creation.

I'm not an active standup content consumer. The only times when I search for standup is when I'm having a meal & just wanna see something random. That's why I don't remember many names except Upmanyu & Bassi because of their unique names.

I watch everything in incognito meaning there's no way for YT to recommend me anything based on me. So each search has fresh user results & that's why, on rare occasions when I see something at the top from a female creator is when I click on that first. But overtime, I realized the pattern that whoever it is, I always have to go back & open some other video because in the first few minutes of the video only, most of them have content that starts with 'I'm a woman. Laugh'. It somewhere feels is the same case with other content on YT/IG.

Any idea why?

*Please recommend me some good female creators/comedians too if that's not the case. I might have missed some good ones.*

1063,How much sex does an Indian man has?,"In the afternoon, I saw a post where the man was ranting how he barely has sex with his wife, who has become averse to sex. There are multiple posts by men where they lament that they're virgins and in their late 20s. Posts where they are scared of being intimate with their wives as they never touched a girl before.

These kind of posts led me to a train of thoughts. 

People reach their sexual maturity by 17-18 (or earlier). The earlier generations used to get married early, by 22-23, so they likely could enjoy their intimate life, if they wanted to. Even if they didn't want to, they had the access to sex.

But our generation is different. Even in our time, lots of people have imbibed the earlier values of abstinence and no-sex-before-marriage, but marriages happen very late. Now I know marriage is the only way lots of Indian men will ever get to touch a woman, but I did some calculations.

Most men get married by their late 20s and early 30s. Suppose a man works his ass off to get financial stability and gets married by 28. He has good sex life for a year and then his wife gives birth. Then they get busy for 2-3 years with the child. And barely have sex. Then another child and another few years. 

By this time he is 35-36. Then the responsibilities of raising the children, their education, etc starts. And this can go on for two decades, and by that time, he'll be in mid 50s. And I doubt if his wife will still have the drive.

In all this time, there is only a few years (2-3?) of actual privacy and stress free time when a man can enjoy intimacy, rest of the time, there are responsibilities dragging him down. 

My aim of creating this post is not to state a fact, but to know whether these thoughts are correct and to what extent. Am I overthinking? Is this analysis correct? Can this be a reason for sexual frustration?",253,AskIndia,"Flair_id    0c1b1aea-3166-11e5-aaec-0ef63926eacd

1071,Please I need help. My family engaged me at 17 with 15 yo village girl who 's not studying anymore and I'm a 21 yo software engineer. I get so depressed while thinking about situation I'm in and feels like giving up [serious],"hello everyone,

I'm in a complicated situation. please help me to deal with it. it's a long story..

    about me

I'm 21M. I come from slightly above poor class and I live with big joint happy family. my father is farmer and my whole family worked hard for paying my college fees. Currently I'm in my last semester of bachelor with computer science and recently got my first internship + job offer. it made me, my parents and family so happy. I'm currently highest earning member in my family)

&#x200B;

    culture

In the area where I live, most boys and girls gets engaged by around 12-18 and married by 20-22. so when I finished my 10th(when I was 15) my family decided to make engagement of me , I was studying in another town that time(in hostel) so I denied them but when I finished 12th they all told me that why is it so important to do engagement right now  or else they wont be able to find good girl for me later. (they all think it's their responsibility to find a girl for me, tbh I can't blame my parents but it's whole culture in my area) and also they gave me example of few boys which couldn't got married and are at age 25-30 (those boys didn't studied well, or with not good family reputation and most doing labor work while I was bit brilliant student compared to them, but still idk my family would compare me with them and tell me I would stay unmarried like them) and I was really stupid that time(at age 17)

&#x200B;

    engagement

they somehow convinced me for engagement and I got engaged with girl from near village.  Let's name her ""A"" . A's father is also farmer with slightly above poor class background. it's been almost 4 years of my engagement  and yet I've not seen her properly in real life. Never talked with her in my life. she was like 15 at my engagement, and failed in 10th that time(but my parents told me it's okay because they used to think ""the girl who study more, will not behave with me and won't do any chores or work"", another reason they were okay with that because they were not sure if I'll get a good job after finishing my studies or end up like my older brothers from my family who finished their colleges but still doing farming and labor work.

A's not studying since she failed 10th(it's been almost 4 years), which is normal around my area many girls don't study after 8th or 10th. now situation are getting better in my area girls going to study in another town, but we're still far behind.

&#x200B;

    problems

I was so foolish that time, but from past few months I've realized that my engagement was a huge mistake. I'm a software engineer so I'll need to move to Bangalore in a year or two for better opportunities. I don't want to live here. I even want to get job abroad if I get chance in future. but she cant even read English, idk if she's able to write even Hindi because primary school sucks where I live. Teachers do their own things and don't take class properly. my father sent me to good schools by paying fees that's why I was able to achieve good job.

Most relatives of mine are farmers and below middle class background and it was a very hot topic in my village and relatives when I got my job and also there's good reputation of my father in my village. and there's one more fact that's related to my story is my aunt(sister of my father) has a little girl, she's  like 12. Let's name her ""B""(my sister cousin), my aunt engaged ""B"" to the little brother of ""A"".  each family is happy with each other and have good relation but I've been so worried about my future and if's she's the one for me. I can think of two ways right now:

* If somehow A could study more, can get developed mentally, I start talking with her and we get along with each other. but I'll have to compromise and there's only if she could pass 10th and 12th. Sometimes I even thought if she clear her basic qualification like till 12th, I'd make her to go college after marrying, so she can get developed mentally and know English and basic stuff. so we both get along with each other well. and every family stays happy. Can we stay happy like this?
* I tell my parents to break the engagement. but it'll make everyone sad and everyone's gonna so surprised. I don't even know if my parents would agree to that. that decision will/might create another problems like:

1. it'll put my father's reputation down in my village (my father actively leads/participates many events in village. and I think he won't be able to go in events if I break engagement, he will not be happy)
2. I love my aunt and she's really sweet but she won't be happy. it might create problem for her daughter(my little cousin) ""B"" in future cause she's engaged to ""A""s brother.
3. I'm not sure what will happen to ""A"" if I break the engagement, I'll make her sad. and her father will have to find another boy for her. ( her family and everyone else gonna think I got good job so I left her, which is somewhat true. but they did nothing wrong tho, I blame the old culture for everything.

while I'm in this situation, my college friends are dating and having fun. I feel sad and so unfair. I get FOMO of dating culture, my college friends don't know I'm engaged. but I can't date any other girl while being engaged, which will be like cheating to ""A"" even tho I've never talked to her in my life. I always acted strong with my friends that all dating and stuff is waste of time but all time but inside me I was wishing if I was born in big city and try dating by myself. wish I had life like them. I Just want to travel and explore.

I know dating is not easy as it seems but I feel like I should be getting chance to explore by myself Idk. I'm average looking guy and really skinny but I've started working on myself.

&#x200B;

I'm crying at nights while thinking about it and I feel stupid about realising so late. I honestly don't know what to do. Sorry for long post. Thanks for reading it and you can ask questions in comments if you have confusion about anything.

Please suggest what should do in this situation?

1072,My mom abused me when I was in 5th grade all the way up to 8th grade,"Currently, I am in 10th grade. My mom used to scratch my face and hands with her nails whenever she was angry with me, or whenever she was angry with my father(My dad lives in the US). My father also abused her and the same stress she showed on me. I used to plead with my mom every time not to do that because the next day my friends and others would ask about the scars on my face and hands but she used to pay no need and just continue. One day in 8th grade I just got irritated and just beat her so much that when she was running away I just beat her back. She stopped doing it after that but she still continues to comment.

1082,Can y'all tell me if stray dogs kill the cat and take her body too? My cat has dissappeared 2 days ago and haven't returned yet.,"So my pet cat of 4 years disappeared 2 days ago. She never wandered outside, all she wanted was to hang around in my garden and stay inside home and never outside. 

Let's come to the main point now, recently some stray dogs have started jumping inside my house and chase my cats but they've been unsuccessful. But two days ago I wokeup and saw my cats hair and dried blood near my garden and the blood wasn't scattered at all, it was all on just one spot, and some few drops on the wall. And just to add, I have 3 cats in total, so while playing w em she had her hair ripped out from her neck but she wasn't injured. So if she was killed by dogs, where is her body? And why the blood drops are not scattered in traceable way that her body was moved out? Or she was injured at the same place and she ran away as they say cats often dissappear when they know they're about to die.

I'm devastated as fuck right now and don't know what to assume. Nothing helps rn because she loved me the most in my family. I am more sad because I don't know what exactly happened to her, and where is she, or dead or alive, I don't fucking know!",250,AskIndia,"Flair_id    0c1b1aea-3166-11e5-aaec-0ef63926eacd

So I was wondering whether are there any people like me in our country.

1086,Sexless Marriage,"**Throwaway Account **
[Advice][M, 31] Me and my wife married 5 years ago through an arranged marriage. We both are working. My wife does not have sex with me more than once a month. When we do have sex it feels like she is doing it just for sake of it and nothing more. When I bring the issue up she makes me feel that I am some kind of pevert to want more sex and should stop pestering her. She says things like ""stop behaving like a perpetually horny teenager, we are a married couple"" or ""you are always horny , no matter the ammount of sex it will never be enough"". 

When we courted before our arranged marriage, we discussed about sex and how important it is for a fulfilling married life. She agreed with me for that most part and said she has a high sex drive. I told her in no uncertain terms that I would want a decent amount of sex and have different varieties of it. 
The first 1 to 1 and a half year(s) of our marriage were great. Lots of sex (atleat 2x a week), different kinks and did it in lot of fun and novel places. For my part I made sure to make her orgasm too so she's satisfied.

Her views about sex and her sex drive have totally changed. Talking isn't yielding any results. It feels that we are generally growing distant and less intimate. I take her for dinner dates, I give her expensive gifts and jwellery for birthday and anniversary. In 2019 we went on a romantic Europe trip thinking maybe that would help.

I have done everything I can think of that could help. I feel really frustrated. She refused counselling saying ""this problem only exists for you and you are not entitled to sex. Stop thinking about getting a hard on all the time"". For the record, I have never acted in an entitled manner with regards to sex with her, infact this comment hit me really hard. 
I feel maybe I am pressuring her and I just hate this feeling.
Any advice is much appreciated. Pl help r/india.",159,AskIndia,"Flair_id    0c1b1aea-3166-11e5-aaec-0ef63926eacd

1097,Why are Indian doctors at OPDs never on time?,"Have been taking my parents and grandparents to OPD doctors for years now. One thing that hasn't changed is the doctors' punctuality. From general physicians to super-specialists, no doctor ever comes on time. On average, doctors start seeing patients at least an hour later than the stated OPD time. Some delay by more than 2 hrs! I would understand if the delay happens once or twice. But, every time?

I am genuinely curious to understand the reason behind this. Is the doctor's schedule that unpredictable or are they just not punctual. To an average person like me, it seems that the doctors do not value the patient's time.

If the schedule really is unpredictable, can they not inform the patients earlier?

Edit: I thank all the doctors for replying and clarifying my doubts. It does seem that the problem is manifold. The only solution might be to increase the number of doctors.

1111,Team Lead keeps calling me for help after I resigned. Should I call back?,"For context I resigned from my job and my last working day was 5 days ago. I had to resign because of the bad work culture. And specifically because of my Team Lead's personality. He had very little domain knowledge, never provided any input but took all credit, and did not think twice while abusing me. For instance he has threatened me that he 'will make my life harder' if I don't agree to write code for a completely new project while in my 28 days of being in resignation period.  I joined as a fresher to this company, and it was not just me but everyone suffered under his hands to the point where an experienced colleague switched to a different job after only 5 months in my company. Another fresher and my colleague also switched 15 days before me. I quit citing higher studies as a reason which is partially true. 

After these resignations one after the other there was a probe by senior manager where the entire team complained about him. But no action was taken saying that,'we can't make someone lose their job'. Okay sure. But atleast give him a warning or something?

So, I hand him over everything and explain my code in KTs. He didn't have any questions during those sessions. Now 5 days later he has called me twice today morning. I have replied back to all his queries. However he again called me back about 15 mins ago for the third time and I didn't pick up the call.

I really don't want to help this moron anymore. My question is If I don't pickup the call, will there be any consequences? What should I do? I do want him to figure it out on his own.

Edit: was just talking to a fellow colleague who still works there and he told me that my TL was complaining about me and the the other fresher (who left a few days before me), telling him that we both wrote 'farzi' code and that we did entire 'kachra' of projects we were handling. But never heard him of helping us or telling that to our face when we were part of the team. I know for a fact my code was not 'kachra'. He's spreading lies and backbiting now.

He rings my doorbell after 10 mins claiming I destroyed his bike rendering it useless and it won't even start to which I was taken aback, I went to just check if his supposed claim was right and somehow me touching the bike would make it inoperable, to my surprise his bike was working perfectly alright. then I asked him to leave the premises since there want no reason for him to stay.

he went on regardless and filed a fake complaint against me that I 'grabbed his collar, beated him up, called him names and whatnot' upon the arrival of police they told me what he complained about and apart from eye witness being there and saying this was all a sad attempt to milk money. rather police being just. they accused me instead and asked me that ' gareeb aadmi h' , does being gareeb qualifies you to scam? since the police clearly doesn't care for it.  ultimately, I had to pay the delivery guy 1k rupees cause he's gareeb and has the authority to do such heinous acts.

and apparently his bike wasn't working as he claimed but as soon as he got paid he started his bike and went away like it was nothing.

Please advise me on how to move forward regarding this. can I take any action on the false report he filed?

1115,Cow Menace in my locality," Everyday i step out of my house, there's a lot of STRAY cows chilling and roaming everywhere i see. One day, while my mom & sister were taking our dog out for a walk, a cow chased and ATTACKED them to the point of injury, almost crushing our little dog (he ran for like 500m and reached home alone). We're not the only ones victim to them. Numerous people have complained about this 'Gau Gang'. Most of them are dog owners.

The cows are about 30 in number and occupy a particular road stretch, even sleep there in a line. here are HUGE piles of cow dung throughout the stretch (2 foot in height and 20 metre in length at times, surrounding a lake of allegedly gaumutra) Some even jump fences and enter the park. Apparently no one knows who owns them, or how they came there. The ward councilor/MLA won't cooperate.

No disrespect for any religious feelings, but I personally care about the safety & security of my family more than finding a purpose to worship them. I feel terrible to see cows in such condition. They need to be in a better place.

He comes from a typically rich business family and when compared to his my family my family is pretty average. We come from different religions too. We thought the latter would be the problem on both sides. That’s a logical thing to think, right? But no. Things got so out of control when he told his parents. It was a big no for them and the reason was that the families don’t match!!! Can you believe it? I could still understand if things were reversed and my parents said it(mind you not that it would have been right) since i have to go live there but in this case? How does it even matter? On top of that his parents took is phone and all other devices and emotionally blackmailed him to tell me that things are over. Who does that to a 30 year old? Who in this generation does things based on what other people think? 

Honestly i am here to rant because I’m so frustrated but it makes me wonder whether it was wrong for us to get into relationship.

1151,Uttar Pradesh under Ajay Series - Part II,"Few days back, I posted the first post of this series where **we saw how GDP growth of Uttar Pradesh in the first 3 years under Ajay was the same as the first 3 years under Akhilesh**.     

So why do many people think Ajay has radically transformed UP's economy? It's mainly because of fake news & and also some ambiguously worded news in Main Stream Modia. Let's debunk some of this.   

---   

#1) UP surges to second spot on GSDP list of 2020-21, beats Gujarat & Tamil Nadu. 
#Is it true? No, Fake News.

Many of you may have seen the article which appeared in Feb 2021 in Main Stream Modia   
[**UP surges to second spot on GSDP list of 2020-21, beats Gujarat & Tamil Nadu**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-surges-to-second-spot-on-gsdp-list-beats-gujarat-tn/articleshow/81219023.cms)

Fake claims from the article    

**1)** ~~UP's GSDP in the 2020-2021 financial year has crossed Rs 19.48 lakh crore~~   
**FAKE** - UP's GSDP for 2020-21 was Rs. 17.05 lakh crore

**2)** ~~UP has climbed from #5 in 2019-20 to #2 in 2020-21~~     
**FAKE** - UP was #3 at the end of Akhilesh's Term, UP was at #3 in 2019-20 & UP remains #3 in 2020-21

**3)** ~~UP went ahead of Gujarat & Tamil Nadu~~      
**FAKE** - UP was ahead of Gujarat even at the end of Akhilesh's term & UP didn't go ahead of Tamil Nadu even in 2020-21. TN was ahead.

(Note: The article's claims were based on GSDP under current price)

#2) How Ajay is beginning to recast UP as a business friendly destination.  
#Well, not really!    

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/how-yogi-adityanath-is-beginning-to-recast-up-as-a-business-friendly-destination/articleshow/77305692.cms

The article uses a source called ""Projects Today"" to show that Uttar Pradesh is getting a lot of investments.  

So let's go to the source itself - Projects Today.

https://projexsurvey.projectstoday.com/2020/04/06/raise-in-government-spending-is-the-need-of-the-hour

From Projects Today 

**Top 5 states for private investment in Financial Year 2020 - Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha, Rajasthan & West Bengal**   


Rank | State | Private Investments
---|---|---  
1 | Maharashtra | 1,06,922 crore
2 | Gujarat | 1,02,346 crores
3 | Odisha |  50,000 crores
4 | Rajasthan | 44,857 crore
5 | West Bengal | 35,299 crore


**Uttar Pradesh wasn't even in the top 5 states in 2020 for private investments**. And West Bengal was.  
   
And while checking this, I also came across Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in different states in 2018-19 (can't find for other years on the site)    

From Observer Research Foundation (ORF) [Foreign Direct Investment in Indian States in 2018-19](https://orfonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ORF_Monograph_FDI-States.pdf)  


\#1 - Maharashtra   
\#2 - Delhi   
\#6 - Gujarat  
\#**8 - West Bengal**     
\#11 - Rajasthan  
\#**12 - Kerala**    
\#14 - Punjab   
\#15 - Odisha   
\#**19 - Uttar Pradesh**   
\#20 - Madhya Pradesh

So yeah, Ajay is beginning to recast UP as a business friendly destination. **Really?**

1177,Chitra Ramkrishna Saga: Musings after reading the SEBI order,"The feeling that one gets reading the order is that this was the most convenient way to conclude a MOST inconvenient problem at the countries leading bourse. \[Order: [https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/feb-2022/final-order-against-ms-chitra-ramkrishna-and-others\_56030.html](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/feb-2022/final-order-against-ms-chitra-ramkrishna-and-others_56030.html)\]

Please remember that no real information has been made available by either SEBI or NSE on the co-location scam from earlier. Which is now being investigated by the CBI. The scam was discovered after a whistleblower complaint to SEBI.

***Note***: IT raids took place yesterday (17 Feb 22), 6 days after the SEBI order, and more than 6 years after the 1st whistleblower comment.

# Who wants what

***Chitra Ramkrishna***: It is more convenient for her to present herself as follower of an 'unknown baba', than disclose the true nature of her relationship with Anand Subramanian. 

***Anand Subramanian***: Thanks to the wishy washy SEBI order, it can only be a matter of conjecture about the source of the sway he had over Chitra Ramkrishna.

***The Board:*** If shit was poured down your throat, you would gag; but this Board likes to swallow.

***SEBI***: They do not appear too keen on regulating a financial cornerstone of the Indian economy. Maybe the 3rd time will do the trick.

***NSE***: ""How do you spell the word- '*guvnence*' is it?"" 

\[Note: NSE by virtue of being an exchange also sets the rules for trading of securities. Exchanges due to network effects, usually become monopolies, and are therefore heavily supervised. NSE is the world's largest derivatives exchange by volume\]

# The fabulous life of Anand Subramanian

***01 April 2013*** :Joins NSE on the same date as Chitra Ramkrishna took over as the Managing Director (MD). He is appointed the Chief Strategic Advisor, a part-time consultant role with 4 day work week for 1.68 CR i.e at over 11 times his then salary. He was interviewed only by Chitra Ramkrishna; for a post that was not advertised. No other person was shortlisted or interviewed for the position. Within NSE the terms of contract are significantly better than that of any other consultant. He had no prior relevant industry or subject matter experience. He only reports to Chitra Ramkrishna.

***01 April 2014***: Receives a raise of 33.6 Lakhs. The salary he was drawing a year before was 15 lakhs. Now a year later he earns more than 13 times that amount. With no prior relevant experience. No record of performance evaluation is available with NSE.

***01 April 2015:*** He receives a raise of 1.31 crores. He now earns 3.33 crore, 22 times his salary from 2 years ago. He is made the Group Operating Officer and Advisor to the Managing Director- (i.e CR). His work week is increased from 4 to 5 days. No approval is taken from the Nomination & Remuneration Committee. He is not declared as a “Key Managerial Personnel"".

***11 August 2015***: The Board grants him powers at par with those of the Managing Director(i.e CR), despite being only a Consultant. He starts attending all Board Meetings. Most department heads also begin reporting to him.

***01 April 2016***: He receives a raise of 1.31 crore. He now earns 4.21 crore, more than 28 times his salary from 3 years ago. He is again working part-time. No record of performance evaluation is available with NSE. Various foreign and domestic travel issues are overlooked internally at NSE.

***21 October 2016***: A month ago in response to 2 whistleblower complaint, SEBI had asked that the matter be placed before the Board (SEBI notice: 15 September 2016). The board allows Anand Subramanian to resign after the SEBI letter is discussed at the Board meeting. This is not recorded in the minutes of the meeting by the Board. The matter is not reported to SEBI.

# SEBI: Slow and slower

1180,Modi's Folly - Part II,"This is a follow up to a post I recently wrote arguing that Modi is going to do something very foolish. You can find it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/rwr7ja/modis\_folly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/rwr7ja/modis_folly/)

To recap, folly, for the purposes of this post, is any action or set of actions that undermine the interest of the person taking this action. Barbara Tuchman’s excellent book, The March of Folly ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_March\_of\_Folly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_March_of_Folly)), examines many such follies conducted by seemingly capable governments.

In this post, I wish to examine what the nature of Modi’s folly will be. Buckle up.

Modi has one and only core competence: dividing India for his political gains. He does not have any other skills. He neither cares nor understands economics or climate change or foreign policy or education policy or health policy. He will use this skill of pitting Indians against other Indians and will pursue this policy to the bitter end despite all its costs.

This approach will have one primary result and many secondary results. The primary result of Modi’s extreme divisive skills is going to be that the Indian population will be in a constant state of outrage about irrelevant issues such as SRK giving dua at Lata Mangeshkar’s funeral ([https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/shah-rukh-khan-trolled-after-offering-dua-at-lata-mangeshkars-funeral-celebs-react-7761321/](https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/shah-rukh-khan-trolled-after-offering-dua-at-lata-mangeshkars-funeral-celebs-react-7761321/)) or the ongoing Hijab row in Karnataka ([https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hijab-row-live-protests-intensify-spread-to-other-states-karnataka-high-court-hearing-today-2757432](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hijab-row-live-protests-intensify-spread-to-other-states-karnataka-high-court-hearing-today-2757432)).

At this point, let me take a break and bemoan the people of my country as well. Indians are like putty in the hands of Modi. Modi understands how to monopolise the attention of Indian people. For the last one week, all I have seen in media about India is Hindu-Muslim. This is what even the people of India seem to want. They consider these issues to be very important. People are out on the street protesting for or against Hijab. The reaction of Indians to these issues is what makes Modi confident in his ability to manipulate the emotions of enough Indians into voting for him.

Some may argue that identity issues are extremely important. They might have some importance. But I would argue that there are burning issues that Indians distracted by WhatsApp University and Godi media are completely ignoring. What are the issues of real importance? In my opinion: economic policy, climate change, foreign policy, education policy and health policy, not necessarily in that order.

The budget was announced less than 10 days ago. I have not seen any meaningful discussion about the budget because people are going insane about all the issues regarding hijab, school uniforms and identity. For a take on how disastrous the budget is, please take a time to watch this video. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPIPejVpvjY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPIPejVpvjY)

Quick summary for those who have not watched: unlike all the previous governments, this government has no idea what the GDP will be in 3 years time, no idea of what policy will result in the budgeted GDP, no idea of what simple things like current account deficit will be. According to Rathin Roy, who used to work as an economic advisor to the Finance Ministry, the present ministry is completely dysfunctional with no idea what it is supposed to be doing.

India probably had the world's deadly second wave of covid. https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/how-indias-second-wave-became-the-worst-covid-19-surge-in-the-world. Any properly functioning country in the world would have been provoked to form a robust health policy with clear deliverables and a plan for handling future epidemics/pandemics. In sharp contrast to what a sane country would do, India does not have a clearly articulated healthcare policy nor has it done much to enhance the budgetary allocation for healthcare.https://[www.business-standard.com/budget/article/budget-2022-despite-covid-pandemic-health-no-longer-the-highlight-122020200049\_1.html](http://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/budget-2022-despite-covid-pandemic-health-no-longer-the-highlight-122020200049_1.html). This is very disappointing in the light of the terrible public health infrastructure in India with among the lowest doctors per capita in the world. https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/medical-doctors-(per-10-000-population)

Similarly, there is no focus on education. There was a New Educational Policy that was announced a while ago. https://education-services.britishcouncil.org/insights-blog/india’s-new-education-policy-2020-highlights-and-opportunities. However, no one I know ever engages with issues like these. They are all focused on Hijab.

What about climate change? Is there is climate policy outlined by this government? The only thing I see is that India said that it cannot meet COP-21’s carbon emission deadlines because it needs to industrialise before it cuts emissions. https://www.carbonbrief.org/indias-indc. 

But I see no progress on either industry or emissions. In fact, manufacturing’s share of GDP has actually fallen since Modi has taken office. [https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/manufacturing-output](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/manufacturing-output)

Let’s briefly glance at foreign policy before I wrap this up. Aside from hugging global leaders in a most embarrassing way, Modi does not know anything about foreign policy. I am not aware of a foreign policy strategic vision developed by this government nor a step-by-step action plan for achieving any strategic vision. This leaves India vulnerable to Modi’s adventurism around election times. While ignoring China’s real occupation of Indian territory ([https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/china-has-built-village-in-arunachal-pradesh-show-satellite-images-exclusive-2354154](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/china-has-built-village-in-arunachal-pradesh-show-satellite-images-exclusive-2354154)), come election time, Modi will drop a few bombs in some border district in Pakistan carefully avoiding hitting anything important. I don’t believe he has the courage to do anything significant in foreign policy. He is mostly interested in electoral gains from high decibel claims of having put Pakistan in its place.

So what will Modi’s folly be? It will be the distraction of people away from real issues to irrelevant ones. By whipping up sentiments against other Indians, Modi will make sure that no Indian has any brain space left to think about significant issues. Indians, glad to participate in contests of religious superiority, will be in a constant state of distracted outrage while the country goes to shit. In the best case scenario, our country will have failed to live up to its potential because of these distractions. In the worst case scenario, these tensions will mount to the point where we will be trapped in a constant state of violence. On this optimistic note, I will conclude my analysis.",54,Policy/Economy,"Flair_id    91a7550c-3166-11e5-9d94-0e09b4299f63

1190,Modi's Folly,"As a gambling man, I think it is certain that Modi is going to do something spectacularly foolish that will make demonetisation look like a well planned and executed masterstroke. It is a matter of when rather than if.

I came to this conclusion as I was reading the excellent 1984 book, The March of Folly ([https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10302.The\_March\_of\_Folly](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10302.The_March_of_Folly)) by Barbara Tuchman.

In the book, Tuchman defines Folly as “the pursuit of policies \[by rulers and leaders\] contrary to the government’s own interests, despite the availability and knowledge of feasible alternatives.” [https://cnewa.org/magazine/the-march-of-folly-33064/](https://cnewa.org/magazine/the-march-of-folly-33064/)

She demonstrates various governments’ follies using four key historical events: the Trojan War, the Catholic/Protestant split, George III’s loss of American colonies and the Vietnam War.

In all these events, the people holding power made decisions that ultimately destroyed themselves and their constituents in spite of having better advice available.

“Folly is the child of power.” This line struck me as being particularly relevant to Modi. With no doubt, he is one of the two most powerful men in India. Depending on who you talk to, they will assert that Shah is more powerful than Modi. But Modi’s power is undeniable. It would also not be too foolish to argue that he is the most powerful because it is doubtful that Shah can win elections without Modi as the primary face.

There is a further point that Tuchman makes about power. She argues that the repeated usage of power results in irresponsible usage of it. In her book she shows many examples of leaders who became very irresponsible in the way they used power. Mao, for example, destroyed China through wild policies such as Great Leap Forward ([https://www.thoughtco.com/the-great-leap-forward-195154](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-great-leap-forward-195154)) and the Cultural Revolution ([https://www.britannica.com/event/Cultural-Revolution](https://www.britannica.com/event/Cultural-Revolution)). Indira Gandhi’s imposition of Emergency is another illustration of irresponsibility with power. [https://openthemagazine.com/columns/indira-gandhis-emergency/](https://openthemagazine.com/columns/indira-gandhis-emergency/).

Modi is not known for his judicious use of power. From Godhra to demonetisation to his foolish lockdown in the first wave of Covid to his cavalier handling of the second wave to a highly botched vaccine program, examples abound of his irresponsibility with power.

Instead of chastising Modi for his irresponsible use of power, the people of India, drunk on Hindutva kool-aid, have rewarded him. He can do no wrong. The media fawns over his every disaster and labels it a masterstroke. His cronies praise him profusely to seek various favours. Given the non-stop adulation for his every move, Modi probably feels a sense of invincibility. His arrogance was recently shown in his comment about the deaths of farmers. [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/an-arrogant-modi-asked-did-500-farmers-die-for-me-meghalaya-guv-satya-pal-malik-stirs-fresh-row/videoshow/88668705.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/an-arrogant-modi-asked-did-500-farmers-die-for-me-meghalaya-guv-satya-pal-malik-stirs-fresh-row/videoshow/88668705.cms)

Modi’s is also clearly showing a common side effect of power: paranoia.

Power induces paranoia. Hitler was extraordinarily paranoid, for example. [https://historyofyesterday.com/why-did-hitler-lose-the-war-was-his-paranoid-schizophrenia-a-factor-1dd66a083829](https://historyofyesterday.com/why-did-hitler-lose-the-war-was-his-paranoid-schizophrenia-a-factor-1dd66a083829). Several extremely powerful people engaged in dangerous behaviour due to their paranoia. [https://www.anxiety.org/psychology-of-dictators-power-fear-anxiety](https://www.anxiety.org/psychology-of-dictators-power-fear-anxiety)

The signs of paranoia are obvious in Modi. He just claimed that Punjab created a security threat for him when he tried to inaugurate some infrastructure projects there. [https://www.rediff.com/news/report/apne-cm-ko-thanks-kehna-modis-dig-at-channi-over-security-lapse/20220105.htm](https://www.rediff.com/news/report/apne-cm-ko-thanks-kehna-modis-dig-at-channi-over-security-lapse/20220105.htm). Further, Modi has a history of claiming that people are trying to assassinate him. [https://caravanmagazine.in/politics/many-plots-to-assassinate-narendra-modi](https://caravanmagazine.in/politics/many-plots-to-assassinate-narendra-modi)

Paranoia arising from power leads to a growing list of perceived enemies. There are many examples among despots. Take Stalin, for example ([https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/2016/06/15/joseph-stalins-paranoid-purge/](https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/2016/06/15/joseph-stalins-paranoid-purge/)). Xi Jingping is famous for his purges of various perceived enemies. [https://tfiglobalnews.com/2021/10/06/jinping-cracks-down-on-loyalists-too-as-coup-fears-worsen/](https://tfiglobalnews.com/2021/10/06/jinping-cracks-down-on-loyalists-too-as-coup-fears-worsen/).

I could stop here. Unaccountable power held by a narcissistic authoritarian is recipe enough for policy mis-steps. But the case for disastrous policy gets stronger if you consider my next few points.

Modi loves spectacular events. He suddenly likes to show up on TV, tell people that the country will shut down or that their money is no longer valid or organise a campaign event for Trump on foreign soil. He has always marketed his foolish actions with wall-to-wall coverage.

While this entire post is speculative so far, my last point is even more speculative. I strongly suspect that Modi’s erratic behaviour can also be attributed to his beliefs in Hindu magic and superstition. Modi has not tried to hide his Hindu religiosity. Most Hindus believe in astrology, numerology, vaastu and various other superstitions. I suspect that thaali banging and diya lighting to fight corona had a lot to do with astrologers’ advice. [https://www.ndtv.com/blog/why-india-follows-modis-call-for-thali-banging-diyas-2206871](https://www.ndtv.com/blog/why-india-follows-modis-call-for-thali-banging-diyas-2206871). Similarly, I think the entire central vista project might be the result of vaastu advisors.

Now, let me summarise this: Modi is an extremely powerful, paranoid man who has not been held to account for his misdeeds. He has repeatedly demonstrated he is cavalier in his usage of power. Our Prime Minister is more likely to listen to religious pundits than subject matter experts. On top of all these factors, he has a penchant for high impact, dramatic events. As he gets used to wielding power over 1.4 billion people, he will need to increase the scale of his policy missteps to get his fix. Therefore, he is going to do something huge and foolish. It is inevitable.

While it is difficult to predict with accuracy what foolishness he will engage in, it is a bit easier to analyse the impact of whatever he does. If you enjoyed reading this, let me know in the comments below and I will try to speculate on the type of impact his foolishness can have.",177,Policy/Economy,"Flair_id    91a7550c-3166-11e5-9d94-0e09b4299f63

1200,"30% tax on Digital assets. some thoughts and views, i could be wrong."," It’s come a long way, from all the FUD about ban and crashing the market to launching it’s own Digital currency to a 30% flat tax across digital assets.

A number of things could happen

* This would also cause significant outflow of wealth as people would wanna realize their profits in more favorable countries. 
* It puts a huge dent in the P2P marketplace on exchanges, i really don;t know now how they would react but it hits the middle class there, one can make a healthy amount here and it’s capped already.
* The government till now has done nothing to boost the blockchain industry, it’s only sent shockwaves, even now there is no consumer protection, or regulations against leverage / Margin trading like australia, no safe guards or internal infrastructure / guidelines.
* Creators economy and web 3.0 would suffer because there is no distinction of earning a salary or getting paid in crypto. New age streaming and open world platforms such as Audius, Decentraland, The Sandbox, brave etc etc, have a huge indian component within the community, and they pay you in crypto so a 30% there isn’t really fair at all. Also all the blockchain professionals working in india remotely would be affected.
* Also traditional services such as telemedicine, digital marketing for international clients who are paying in Stable coins or the crypto or choice on a case to case basis also suffer.
* Hence People would keep their crypto and spend it, boosting the eco-system in general. I rather pay for goods and services in BTC or stable coins rather than convert into fiat and pay taxes. You should see a housing price chart in BTC for the last 10 years, it’s a downward trend. Currently you can buy anything on amazon using crypto, its a little tedious since you have to use a separate service to deposit your crypto and generate Amazon gift cards, these services will skyrocket (https://www.coinsbee.com/en/Amazon-bitcoin) 
* It gets easier for the rich, hampers the only middle class tool where one can benefit from Fractional ownership of as little as Rs 50. Tier 2 and 3 city adoption of this is far higher than the metro’s. A little can go a long way in crypto at an early adopter lever and lots of people in India have very little. 
* Also is it legal now?, can i sell goods and services in crypto? 
* Also CBDC is the precise opposite of what Crypto offers. (inflationary and  traceable as opposed to deflationary and anonymous) also if you commit fraud you will be caught, just that no third party can benefit from your payment details and start sending you mailers, messages and so on, there is a basic level of anonimity.
* also crypto is now 100% legal, can't tax something illegal.",25,Policy/Economy,"Flair_id    91a7550c-3166-11e5-9d94-0e09b4299f63

1201,Income Tax reforms done during UPA era (2004-2014),"When UPA took over, everyone earning over 50,000 was subject to income taxes & everyone who earned over 1.5 Lakhs came under Maximum Tax Bracket.

By 2013, they had raised minimum from 50K to 2 Lakhs & maximum from 1.5 Lakhs to 10 Lakhs.

Budget | Minimum Tax Slab | Maximum Rate Tax Slab

So in most UPA budgets, the income tax payer got relief. 

---   

When UPA did their final budget - Arun Jaitely was very upset that Manmohanji didn't raise the IT exempt slab to 5 lakh in that budget & heavily criticised Manmohanji for it

[April 2014: Raise IT slab to Rs. 5 lakh, says Arun Jaitley](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/raise-it-slab-to-rs-5-lakh-says-jaitley/article5931663.ece)

> Bharatiya Janata Party leader Arun Jaitley on Sunday demanded that the Income Tax ceiling be raised from Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh, which he claimed would benefit thirty million people.

> If the Income Tax limit is raised from Rs. 2 lakhs to Rs. 5 lakhs, 3 crore people will save Rs. 24 crore which will lead to a small impact of 1 to 1.5 per cent of the National Tax Fund,” the BJP leader said.

8 Years have passed. We still don't have a flat 5 lakh exempt slab. The only flat increase done by Modiji in 8 years is increased from 2 Lakhs to 2.5 Lakhs with no change in Maximum. He also changed the rules such that if you earn less than 5 Lakhs, you aren't taxed - but if you earn more than 5, you are taxed for income above 2.5 Lakhs - for e.g. if you earn 7 Lakhs, you are taxed 5% on your 2.5 to 5 Lakhs & 10% on that above 5 Lakhs. So what BJP cried for in 2014 is still not achieved after 8 years.",108,Policy/Economy,"Flair_id    91a7550c-3166-11e5-9d94-0e09b4299f63

1207,Indian people fanboying over billionaires is the most funniest thing I've seen on twitter.,"There is a billionaire, let's say his name is ""Patani"" has the most bootlicking comment section that I've seen till now. Mr Patani has a Mine which is apparently affecting a biological site (let's call it ""Carrier Grief""). So people from that country started protesting and commented on his twitter posts. And our ultra Twitter Army came for his protection. And till this day the bootlicking is still going on...

But Nevermind, Mr Patani is a good guy and he will surely do what is best for the country.

Here is some data from Oxfam that also inspired me to write this post.

According to Oxfam India “Inequality Kills” report, wealth of India’s richest families reached to a record high in 2021. 

In the report, India was described as ‘**very unequal**,’ country, as top 10 people in India holds **57 per cent** of the wealth. On the other hand, share of bottom half is **13 per cent**.

Report states that, 84 per cent of Indian households witnessed an income decline amid covid-19 pandemic. Richest 98 Indians own the same wealth as bottom 552 million people.

Number of Indian billionaires increased from 102 to 142, during 2021. Wealth of the top 100 families is Rs 57.3 trillion.",79,Policy/Economy,"Flair_id    91a7550c-3166-11e5-9d94-0e09b4299f63

1208,A new breed of people: Inflation Supporters,"Ravish Kumar has coined a new term “Inflation Supporter”. This is a new breed that has been engineered. It’s basically a first line of defense present around you all the time to quell any voices against inflation or bad policies. It makes it really hard for an opposition party to make it an election agenda when people themselves are supporting it. Whenever you hear one of the following arguments, you’ve spotted them. 

1. Because the government constructed good roads, vehicle’s fuel efficiency has gone up
2. People have money to purchase alcohol at ₹1000/liter but complain for petrol at ₹100/liter 
3. Income has increased too. People have money to purchase ₹20 lakh car but don’t have money for petrol at ₹100/liter. Each household has a car now. 
4. Inflation is a fad because many families are ordering food on Zomato 3 times a week
5. Government vaccinated 100 Cr people for free. They gave free ration to 80 Crore. 
6. Nobody complains for a ₹500 movie ticket, so why complaining for inflation?

Ravish ends his show with a gloomy remark that this new breed will eat the society from within.

1212,For people who trade cryptos,"A lot of people don't understand how 1% TDS would effectively deal a death blow to crypto trading.  Generally, TDS is computed on the profit amount or the gain as per the applicable rate, no TDS is charged on losses. But not for Cryptos. You'll be taxed for every transaction irrespective you make a profit or loss. 

A real good example from Moneycontrol highlights this. Thought of sharing.

&#x200B;

>The finance minister has proposed a 30 percent tax on income from the transfer of any virtual assets and a TDS of 1 percent on every transaction. Further, no deductions, including losses on some transactions, are allowed. While the government intends to track the flow of investment in these assets, these provisions can kill trading in these assets.  
  
>  
>Suppose in 10 trades, a trader makes a gross profit of Rs 100,000 and a loss of Rs 50,000, thus posting a net profit of Rs 50,000 — if this was trading in crypto assets, the trader will have to pay a tax Rs 30,000 (at 30 percent) on this gross profit, leaving Rs 20,000 as profit on his table. In speculative trading in the equity markets, his tax would be Rs 15,000, which is 30 percent on the net profit of Rs 50,000, leaving him Rs 35,000.   
  
>  
>The bigger problem is TDS. On every trade, he has to incur a cost of 1 percent as TDS. In 10 trades, it will be equivalent to 10 percent of the money deployed to trade. Normally a very good short-term trader makes anywhere between 3-5 percent on his capital. Assuming an optimistic 10 percent return on investment, the trader will deploy upwards of Rs 10 lakh per trade to generate a net profit of Rs 50,000.  
  
>  
>A TDS of 1 percent on each trade of Rs 10 lakh each for 10 trades would add up to Rs 1 lakh.  
  
>  
>In the end, after incurring the taxes mentioned in the Budget, the trader would be down by Rs 50,000 and the government would have made Rs 130,000 – Rs 100,000 from TDS and Rs 30,000 from capital gains.

1214,NIXI’s justification for 2 domains per person? National Security,"&#x200B;

[ IFF needs your support, now more than ever. Details at the end of this post.](https://preview.redd.it/5my8wsdk7ci81.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f79c48c40532be133f9430cfba44c3f5770ffd4)

## tl;dr

Remember NIXI’s two domain per person policy? The National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI) is the nodal authority for \[dot\]in domains in India. In December 2021, NIXI published an [**undated notice**](https://www.registry.in/registry/images/page/Bulk-Booking.pdf) stating that if any entity wants to register for more than two of India’s Country Code Top Level Domain (ccTLD) - \[dot\]in domains, they'll have to seek written permission from the NIXI CEO. In our [**RTI request**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BLozj0qSBaGKSLySrY8j4IANuBhzk6E3/view?usp=sharing) on this notice, NIXI [**responded**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yi2xjGR0QtRVz0yMzgnInK6NO21Xo_0n/view) with an incomplete response stating that the notice was issued for ""national security"". Go figure.

## Background

NIXI is a government not-for-profit organization, established in 2003 under section 8 of the Companies Act 2013. One of its key tasks is to set up domestic Network Operation Centers (NOCs) among Indian Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to enable routing domestic interest traffic within the country instead of re-routing via NOCs abroad. It results in reduced-bandwidth charges for the ISPs and also provides better quality of service due to reduced latency.

NIXI has been authorized as the .IN Registry by the Government of India, since January 2005. The .IN domain names are available to anyone on a first-come-first-served basis. However, in an [**undated notice**](https://www.registry.in/registry/images/page/Bulk-Booking.pdf) published on its website in December 2021, NIXI said that in case an individual registrant submits a request for registering more than two ccTLDs or if a registered accredited company requests for more than a hundred ccTLDs, then a written approval of the CEO, NIXI is required.

## We asked they refused

After the NIXI order was brought to our notice, we filed an RTI request with them seeking further clarifications and demanding transparency on how the permission would be granted for more than two \[dot\]in domains.

**We requested the following information from NIXI:**

**Request 1**\*\*:\*\* Please provide information regarding the legislation or the power under which the policy change to seek permission for domain registration after two successful registrations have been notified.

**NIXI’s response:**

“The new policy is as per the powers available with the Registry under Registry-Registrar Agreement. (Clause no 9.19).”

Clause 9.19 of the [**Registry-Registrar Accreditation Agreement**](https://www.registry.in/system/files/IN_Registrar_Accreditation_Agreement_1.pdf) states

***“9.19 Amendments****: This Agreement may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of both parties. Notwithstanding anything mentioned here above, .IN Registry at its discretion may post/publish new or amended Policies and/or Advisories on at the Registry Website from time to time and the Registrar accepts that by virtue of their publication on such a website the Registrar shall deemed to have notice of such new or amended Policies and/or Advisories.”*

It defies legal understanding as to how a contractual agreement can empower NIXI’s exercise such powers. Clearly, Clause 9.19 can reserve such powers, however, it cannot by itself create it.

&#x200B;

**Request 2:** Please provide information on whether any legal opinion was sought from the Ministry of Law or any other Ministry for the change in policy.

**NIXI’s response:** “Above decision is taken with respect to National Security.”

&#x200B;

**Request 3:** Please provide information with regard to whether any meetings were conducted to discuss the change in policy. If yes, please provide a list of individuals/ organizations who were a part of those meetings as well as the minutes of the meetings.

**NIXI’s response:** \[no response given\]

&#x200B;

**Request 4:** Please provide information with regard to whether any third party consultations were sought for the change in policy. If yes, please provide information with regard to the basis on which these third parties were selected.

**NIXI’s response:** \[no response given\]

&#x200B;

**Request 5:** Please provide a copy of all documents related to the queries herein specifically any legal opinions, minutes of meetings and reports related to the change in policy.

**NIXI’s response:** \[no response given\]

NIXI refused to provide a response to our request numbers 3, 4 and 5 which is against the letter and spirit of the RTI Act, 2005.

&#x200B;

## Illegal response

The decision of the PIO, NIXI to decline information without giving proper justification under the RTI, Act 2005 is also in contravention of the Central Information Commission’s decision in CIC/OK/A/2006/00163 dated July 7, 2006. In this case, the CIC held that:

*“Through this Order, the Commission now wants to send the message loud and clear that quoting provisions of Section 8 of the RTI Act ad libitum to deny the information requested for, by CPIOs/Appellate Authorities without giving any justification or grounds as to how these provisions are applicable is simply unacceptable and amounts to malafide denial of legitimate information attracting penalties under section 20(1) of the Act.”*

Further, the Hon’ble High Court at Delhi, in its judgment in [***Deputy Commissioner of Police v/s D K Sharma***](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/147621712/) \[W. P. (C) 12428/2009 & CM APPL 12874/2009\], dated 15-12-2010 held that:

*“6. This Court is inclined to concur with the view expressed by the CIC that in W.P. (Civil) 12428/2009 order to deny the information under the RTI Act the authority concerned would have to show a justification with reference to one of the specific clauses under Section 8 (1) of the RTI Act.”*

Further, [**S.8(2)**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1484095/#:~:text=(2)%20Notwithstanding%20anything%20in%20the,harm%20to%20the%20protected%20interests.) of the RTI Act provides that

*“Notwithstanding anything in the Official Secrets Act, 1923 nor any of the exemptions permissible in accordance with sub-section (1), a public authority may allow access to information, if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.”*

Since our request for information was aimed at furthering public interests and increased transparency in decision making, we requested the legal basis of the order, any legal opinion sought, consultations received or requested and minutes of meetings in which such decision was taken. However, declining access to such information indicates a lack of transparency on part of PIO, NIXI.

## Challenges

The reasons to mandate written approval of CEO, NIXI has not been stated in the original notice published on its website. Further, in response to our RTI request, the PIO has merely stated that \[the\] “above decision is taken with respect to National Security.” Repeating “national security” as a mantra to defeat transparency, even when not probably emerging from the topic of policy formation, is a growing tendency in decision making.

Further, the PIO has declined our request for access to documentation of the meetings in which such a decision was taken. There is also a lack of clarity on the grounds on which the approval request may be granted or denied. The notice merely mentions that “approval of CEO, NIXI will be provided within 24 hours of submission of the request irrespective of weekly off/ holiday.”

In absence of a written procedure developed without consultation with stakeholders in a non-transparent way indicates public disinterest on part of NIXI. Further, attempts to thwart information sought through right to information requests harms the spirit of the RTI Act, 2005. We have filed a first appeal against the response received to seek clarifications and to further transparency in public interests.

1219,"Now I am realising, behind poor governance is poor journalism","Based on a small study based on anecdotal evidence and personal experience.

We’ve stayed 34 years of our lives in Chandigarh and we could barely associate with anything that we can remotely say as mischievous, misgovernance, that makes you feel utterly powerless and voiceless.

Last 18 months, we have been staying in Punjab and life is miserably distressing but is full of observations.

1. No electricity for days in cities.
At times, no electricity for 3 days out of the 7 in a week (this is when the demand is low).

Absolutely NO ELECTRICITY in villages.
And that’s the norm.

2. Traffic Jams on not only conventional, interior roads but even on highways connecting cities.

3. No policing.
Alcoholics make merry. Can stop their vehicles wherever, whenever they want. 
No questions asked.


All this, when we are staying in the constituency of the Chief Minister, barely 15 kms away from Chandigarh.


Observation:

There appears to be one important reason behind all this: No Journalism whatsoever.

In Chandigarh, slightest potholes appear on the front pages of the newspapers, forcing prompt actions.

In Punjab, journalistic life is complacent.
Making political life even more complacent.

Complaints stay unheard for months if not for years.

Politics seems mere as a power struggle with no or little emphasis on quality of services being provided to the citizens.

Making me realise in this small microcosm:

When Journalists falter, 
Political Class will.


P.S. - 
The private cost of living rises significantly when one lives in a place with poor governance.

Since we could afford, we now have massive water filteration system installed as the water quality is said to be POISONOUS (according to Kent RO executive). Many people have that now.

We are in the process of buying a personal genset. 
Everyone around us have one.

I believe poor or no journalism is a catastrophe beyond ideologies making citizens virtually powerless and only able to exercise Episodic Accountability every 5 years or so.

Me and my parents had specifically asked them if MYP was part of the curriculum before paying and that salesman said ""yes, more content related to IB is being taught on it to improve their grades"". Later, I learned that it was a filthy lie cause I bet he didn't even know what IB was. I have blocked their number multiple times but they just keep calling regarding ""My progress in the app"" or some stupid board course idk.

Khan Academy is so much better teaching quality content related to my board and most of it for free!

So here is mine","We all know our India is a place a person irrelevant of caste, sex, or religion is and should be equal, this was our founding father's vision it still is. So I am saying people who say India is for Hindus only are sponsored by the CCP. Here's why.  


We all know the World is preparing for WW3 possibly, and China can gain a lot with weakened India.   
India will be on the US side cause Russia and China are the bigger allies.  
China cant fight India headon, cause of our unity. But they know if we are fighting within ourselves we can easily be knocked off. This is the same strategy used by the British to take control of India. We have rats among us people. And these Ultranationalist and the Sanghis are the fucking rats. wake people wake up.  


So anyone who says India is only for Hindus, and the usual crap. Just say they are an Anti nationalist  
and give the reason above  
Cause if you are a real Indian you will treat everyone equally and judge them not on the basis of their religion but of their colour.

1267,Cop Story: Double Standards,"On a bright sunny Sunday, I decided to *bounce* my way to the nearest metro. Since it was just <2km away, I figured that if I ride the electric scooter only at half throttle keeping to the sidelines, at a measly 10kmph, it should be borderline acceptable to not wear a helmet (yes, I know even at 10kmph for a short distance: unsafe, illegal, head explosion, etc. I know.)

Everything was going well, until the white nation attacked. 

I first caught a glimpse of his tide white uniform peeking through the tender coconuts. He was hiding behind the coconut pile, waiting to spring onto the road and pounce on the first traffic offender that comes down the road. I could almost feel his x-ray eyes, scanning through the coconuts. I switched to emergency evasion 101, and swerved to an empty parking spot by the road side. Within mere seconds I completed the necessary payment and the vehicle selfie required to end the bounce ride. 

Now comes the walk of shame across the white knight. I feared that we had locked eyes, and decided that if he were to accost me I'd plead guilty straightaway. 

As I neared the coconut pile, the white knight sprung into action, leaping halfway across the road. I winced at the blow, a blow that never came. For our hero had found a bigger fish to catch. 

Down the road, thumped a Royal Enfield, cruising well over the speed limit. Cherry on top? It bore a guy and a girl, both without helmet (both wore a fine pair of glistening aviators, if that counts).
Double helmet violation, speeding violation, throw in an bulls eye sticker fine, emission fine coz climate change and a fine for ""you look too cool and privileged"", and you can surely see how big of a catch this was for our white knight. 

Alas! It was not to be. What seemed like a fine catch, turned out to be a hidden Uno reverse card. The bullet screeched to a halt just before the white knights outstretched stop hand. But the rider didn't even flinch. He just directed his gaze below, where nestled on the fuel tank was a tiny helmet. Our white knight followed the gaze with a gulp. He saw that the helmet which was protecting the fuel tank, had the police insignia in front. Clearly, taking your girl out for a ride, was important policy duty. 

Our white knight bows, steps back. It was not to be, he had to let them go. Someday.. someday he will have his vengeance on IPS officers. But for now, he will have to make his lunch money some other way. His gazed shifted onto the next helmet-less bounce rider.

1293,"If we talk about the so called great Education System of India, there is one small experiment conducted by scientists which nicely describes the products of the Indian Education System."," A group of scientists placed 5 monkeys in a cage and in the middle, a ladder with bananas at the top. Every time a monkey went up the ladder, the scientists sprayed the rest of the monkeys with cold water.

After a while, every time a monkey went up the ladder, the others beat up the one going up the ladder. After some time, no monkey dared to go up the ladder **regardless of the temptation.**

Scientists then decided to substitute one of the monkeys. The 1st thing this new monkey did was go up the ladder. Immediately the other monkeys beat him up. After several beatings, the new member learned not to climb the ladder **even though he never knew why.**

A 2nd monkey was substituted and the same occurred. The 1st monkey participated in the beating of the 2nd monkey. A 3rd monkey was changed and the same was repeated. The 4th was substituted and the beating was repeated and finally the 5th monkey was replaced.

What was left was a group of 5 monkeys that **even though had never received a cold shower**, continued to beat up any monkey who attempted to climb the ladder.

**If it was possible to ask the monkeys why they beat up all those who attempted to go up the ladder ... I bet you the answer would be ... ""I don't know — that's how things are done around here""**

Sounds familiar!!! Right?

That's how the Indian Education System is... Everybody is studying but they don't know what they are studying, why they are studying it, why they are following this way of studying, why they are not studying in depth, why they are not using internet to combine some good useful knowledge with the knowledge they are gaining from old text books, why you have chosen this particular stream for graduation, etc. If you ask the students the Question ""WHY???""

1296,Who is Namita Thapar? Shark Tank India,"Hello All Reddit Folks!   
READ IT CAREFULLY!   
This is about a reality show Shark Tank India who have judges like 

 1. Ashneer Grover- Managing Director and co-founder of BharatPe

2. Aman Gupta- Co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer of boAt

3. Anupam Mittal- Founder and CEO of Shaadi.com and People Group

4. Ghazal Alagh- Co-founder and chief of MamaEarth

5. Vineeta SinghCEO and co-founder of SUGAR Cosmetics 

6. Peyush Bansal- Co-founder and CEO of Lenskart

7. Namita Thapar- Executive Director of Emcure Pharmaceuticals

These judges try to understand your business and invest in your ideas and make them help grow. 

My main issue is all judges are okay and they have struggled to bring up their own money and business but why Namita Thapar? She is not a founder. Let me tell you who is she!   
Namita Thapar's actual name is Namita Mehta, Daughter of Industrialist, Satish Mehta who is the CEO and MD of Emcure Pharmaceuticals, founded in 1983. Namita Mehta cleared CA, which is indeed an amazing thing, that too in the first attempt. Later, she went to the US for her master's in Duke School, Well Money Matters.   
Moving ahead, being the child of Satish Mehta, it is very much obvious to have a stake in the firm and become the whole time executive director of the same. Further, she was married to Vikas Thapar, Well I assume that Vikas Thapar is too the son of someone from the Thapar Group. Guys, if you can help me dig out the same. I will appreciate the same.   
After marriage, her name changed to Namita Thapar. Vikas Thapar is the President of Emcure Pharma for Corporate Development, Strategy, and Finance.   
Well, Guys, My point is that She did not start her business and doesn't know the struggle then why she has been chosen? The producer could have taken Founder of Nykaa, Zivame, etc?   
But why only she?   
I hope you all understand the concern.

1303,Perception of different prices by Indians,"I have made a list of assumptions made by Indians for different prices of items, i.e, the value of money we have.

One rupee (Rs. 1/-)
Everyone buys that item in bulk, its usually candy and chocolates for the kids. No one gives a second thought to buy these items.

Two rupees(Rs. 2/-)
Same as one rupee, everyone buys that item in bulk, no one gives a second thought. But some new items can be bought like shampoo sachets and oil packets.

Five rupees(Rs. 5/-)
Not that significant again, can be bought in bulk but the quantity is lesser when compared to one or two rupees. Enough to buy some herbs.

Ten rupees(Rs. 10/-)
Depends on the context of the item. For a pencil its too much but for a milk packet its okay. People don't usually buy these items in bulk without thinking over it.

Twenty rupees(Rs. 20/-)
Quite expensive for a small item like a chocolate bar but for one liter bottles it doesn't seem like much. People don't buy them in bulk unless in a particular situation. Some bakery items are also included here.

Fifty rupees(Rs. 50/-)
These items are pretty costly and are not bought in bulk. People enter into an argument with the mandiwala and autowala to bargain. People consider less cost intensive options.

One Hundred Rupees(Rs. 100/-)
People reckon a lot before buying these items, but not much. They are bought once and are used carefully to exhaustion. Usually not meant for kids.

Five Hundred rupees(Rs. 500/-)
Very expensive, not many people buy these items. These are reserved for special occasions. Mummy will not let you touch these things. People think a lot before investing.

Two thousand rupees (Rs. 2000/-) and more..
No one buys these items unless in a particular situation. They are used scantily and stored out of the reach of children. And if you tamper with them, get ready to get sniped with a chappal from mummy or lashed to oblivion by Papa.",0,Memes/Satire (OC),"Flair_id    81a72c32-6656-11ec-82ca-e64a05c4f3c7

1310,Band Baaja Baraat!,"The wedding season in North India has come to a close. And the biggest revelation I had while attending too many weddings is the ordeal of the dulha and the dangerous possibilities the North Indian groom may have to face.

Of the many such dangers that might exist, the one that I want to focus on is the terrible fate of going through the motions and why there is nothing worse than being a *dulha* while your stomach rumbles.

You'd probably want to dismiss this as implausible but consider the number of sweets and *pakwaans* and drinks an indulgent groom might devour in the days leading up to the auspicious day. Indeed, it is the auspicious nature of the festivities that might trick him into believing he has an immunity shield to anything unfortunate. What a wonderful opportunity to let the digestive tract blow its horn (and eventually other things) and announce its often overlooked presence to the person it belongs to.

Can you really rule out someone pranking the groom to have something nasty? After all, people prepping themselves up for eating a shitload of unhealthy food, possibly getting shitfaced and dancing their balls out are not likely to make wise choices as to what's a sensible prank and what's not. 

The problem can be dealt with but truly assumes its inescapable nature in the moments leading up to the *Baraat.* Baraatis are infamous for taking their time but only to an extent. The groom can't keep coming up with excuses for each new trip to the loo. Eventually, he'll have to leave the plunger and take the plunge. What else will he do? Call up his father-in-law? ""Sorry *sasurji*, I'll receive your daughter on another day. The interplay of intestines must overrule the interplay of stars and kundlis."" 

Let us come to the *baraat* itself where the stakes of the gut become the gravest. Imagine the misery of not wanting to move when the whole world is twisting and wringing their bodies like a towel being dried out. The tightly scrunched up faces of the baraatis as they hammer the road with their feet and grind the gravel, oh if only the expressions didn't seem so suggestive at the moment.

It might be just better to look elsewhere. Maybe the dulha will focus on the slow-moving horses only to see the equine animals brooming their asses with their tails, inducing a possible wave of phantom movement across their own butts. And what if the horse decides to drop a deuce? Will the observation of such behaviour make it more likely for the observer to push out his own? Or will it fulfil the need to take a dump vicariously? It's a question of ""ape see, ape do"" vs mirror neurons.

Amidst all the misery that the dulha might experience at that moment, nothing will infuriate him more than to see his brothers and friends refusing to let the carriage go ahead. Why not one more *thumka*? And why not give the chachaji one more chance to relive his lovemaking to the *naagin* from a past life.

As the baraat prepares to turn down the music in favour of the old-school dholak, will things change? Will the loud percussions convince the groom to maybe add to the music? *Ek main hi na baja du kyu*?

The dulha might just still survive this ordeal. But then the time comes to step down from the carriage and move that which not be moved. Time for the family of the bride to welcome the baraat and the dulha in particular. Despite the situation he finds himself in, the dulha will likely realise the true extent of where he is.  The important question is thus this: Does the pressure of being the *damaad* percolate down to the sphincter? 

Maybe things will be fine after all. The dulha just has to walk to the stage, sit there for a token amount of time and then it won't be odd to take a break to the washroom. Fine, a baraati might encourage the dulha to show a few moves during the walk leading to the stage but I am convinced if there is a way to dance without disturbing the fine machinery in the anus, the dulha will find it. However, there is one situation that shatters my belief in this fantasy. I have observed the dulha being juggled above a sea of baraatis in some weddings. If that happens, well...You can just hope the incoming delivery is as golden as the sherwani.

1316,A request for the people of India,"If you have New Year's plans, kindly rethink. Cases have begun shooting up again, and India still hasn't shrugged off the Delta variant, even though Omicron is the hot topic of discussion. R0 values ( an indicator of epidemic potential) are rising, and have risen to concerning levels already in Delhi and Mumbai. Try to convince friends and family to do the same. Enforce wearing masks again, why do I see so many people without masks now? People will cuss you out, people will call you fear-mongerers, but none of that stands up to the worth of your life, and your health. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better a pill than an endotracheal tube. Covid's still out there. It's real, and the people telling you it isn't are just shutting their eyes to ignore a blind truth. 

Sincerely, a junior - but a witness, sufferer, and treater of Covid 19 - doctor. If you doubt my words, talk to your doctor friends. The entire community is on tenterhooks. Take care, and have a happy, healthy 2022.

EDIT: Added some relevant info I felt important. 

NYE celebrations will absolutely make the covid situation explode, yeah. There's a reason why cases have been exploding suddenly, in the last week of the year, when it was fine through November and early December. 

Also, let me explain R0 to you. A R0 of 2.54 like it is in Delhi means 100 people will infect 254 other people. In a situation like New Years where streets could be packed will tell you how catastrophic it could be. And the obvious step is to start working from home again, it's a no brainer. 

Some more math. Roughly 30% of India is still unvaccinated. That's 400,000,000 people. I'm not inflating the number of zeros. Omicron is just as bad as the OG covid strains in the unvaccinated 

source: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/covid-omicron-variant-symptoms-vaccinated-unvaccinated-20211230.html%3foutputType=amp 

>In the unvaccinated, omicron looks very similar to delta and all the prior variants and the original strain. It can land you in the hospital if you’re unvaccinated and can lead to ICU care or death. It should not be taken as “it’s just a cold” for everyone, because that’s not the case at all.

Quoted for those who want to click. Add comorbidities to the above group to.

And finally, many, many Indians have gotten the Astrazeneca vaccine. It's not very effective after 3 months, and is about 5 times worse than Covaxin. source: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.scroll.in/latest/1013335/astrazenecas-covid-vaccine-protection-wanes-three-months-after-second-dose-says-lancet-study 

Lancet is the gold standard peer reviewed medical journal. 

So, 400 million unvaccinated people, more with comorbidities, vaccine protection reducing and the best kicker, a virus strain that could have a R0 of upto 10.

Source: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(21)00559-2/fulltext

That's a hundred people infecting a thousand. 

So yeah, doctors aren't really fear mongering. There needs to be strict sanitation and social distancing again or the situation could degrade very, very fast. Even by the time boosters begin we could be well, well behind the race. 

Thanks for your time.

1318,Sharing a personal account: Omicron is here and around !,"A family of my cousin living in Mysuru is going through the unspeakable – Omicron! 

Both he and his wife were double-vaccinated though the small children were not. A few weeks ago, he was tested positive and decided to self-isolate and checked into a hospital. After about 10 days he was discharged when the symptoms were gone, and he tested negative.

Last week, his elder child (10-year-old) tested positive after showing fever and cough like symptoms. Soon the younger child (6 yrs) also tested positive with similar symptoms. His wife also began to get feverish and tested positive. All three were advised home quarantine and told no medication required. 

Now the poor guy is having to take care of the family alone since nobody wants to come near. He is learning to cook and feed them and had to rush his elder child to hospital for IV since she had been throwing up and not able to take medication (even paracetamol)

While it is not life threatening, the family is struggling nevertheless. It may take a few weeks before they all recover and get back to their daily routines.

I am sharing this to highlight Omicron is still around. Stay safe and follow basic hygiene and social distancing.",174,Coronavirus,"Flair_id    8041227c-6517-11ea-b83e-0e7048fc0c5b

Only good thing so far is. Hospitalization and severe cases are very less. Although the studies so far have suggested omnicron being less threatening then delta. I'm hoping our hospital infra is able to handle that this time.

===================================================================

This has been particularly disastrous for India. A first world country can afford to close schools & conduct classes offline but a country like India cannot because we are a poor country with a huge digital divide.

[https://www.unicef.org/rosa/media/16511/file/India%20Case%20Study.pdf](https://www.unicef.org/rosa/media/16511/file/India%20Case%20Study.pdf)

54 per cent of urban and 32 per cent of rural population of 12+ years had internet access

* 24 per cent of households have internet facilities,
* A status report on schools during COVID-195 indicated that children studying in government schools were hit particularly hard, with more than **80 per cent of government school students in Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh not receiving any educational materials during the lockdown**. This failure was mostly because families did not have access to digital devices and e-learning tools. In homes that had digital access, WhatsApp was the primary mode (75 per cent) for delivering education in both public and private schools, followed by phone calls between teachers and students (38 per cent). **But more than 75 per cent of parents had trouble ensuring WhatsApp lessons because of the lack of an internet connection or the inability to afford it, or because of poor internet speed/signal**.

Just like all other COVID policies, the poor who form a majority of the country have been screwed to protect us (Wifi/WFH, Bigbasket/Prime class of people)

Children are mostly safe from COVID

For children (ages 5-17) without comorbidities, chances of death from COVID is 0 in 7 million.

Most children have already had COVID without them or anyone else realizing they have had it - because they are mostly asymptomatic.

[A seropositivity study done in Bombay between April 1st to June 15th 2021 showed 50% of children have COVID19 antibodies](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/coronavirus-over-50-of-children-in-mumbai-exposed-to-coronavirus/article35019425.ece).",28,Coronavirus,"Flair_id    8041227c-6517-11ea-b83e-0e7048fc0c5b

1340,Covid 19 has made people stupid beyond belief,"There are two kinds of people right now in this current pandemic.


1. The conspiracy theorist. These are the morons watching too much YouTube and Joe Rogan types. They believe that the virus isn't real or it's a planned event. They will make claims that the pharma industry is behind all the lockdowns and crisis for unknown reasons. In my experience they are generally over educated morons of the right wing persuasion. Right now most people are powerless and helpless and feel terrified. For these overly educated dolts this is something they have never experienced, so to avoid this feeling, they believe that their intelligence is enough to overcome and defeat this threat. So for these imbeciles, they have created elaborate conspiracies in their brain that they and only they can solve. It's a mix of hubris and over estimating their intelligence. These people are generally right wing and anti vax.


2. The Crisis nutjobs. These are the people who want to be locked down, curfewed and protected at all costs. These idiots are want the harshest lockdowns. They over estimate the number of deaths and hospitalization of Covid 19.  They want zero Covid which is just a fantasy. They hate anyone who doesn't follow over complicated Covid protocols and will willingly give bureacracts and politicians life and death power over them. They are essentially hypochondriacs. They are generally not very smart and also watch too much YouTube. They tend to be left leaning.


Here's my two cents on the pandemic.


1. The Vaccine works. No if buts or maybe. If you can get it, get it.

2. The lockdowns are too harsh and ineffective. I've seen people lose businesses and go bankrupt due to Covid. They don't even seem to stop the spread or even slow it down because they are simply impossible to enforce. 

3. The threat posed by Covid is significant for the **unvaccinated**. But even then hospitalization and deaths is still **less than 1%**. For people who have taken **both doses** the threat posed by Covid is almost the same as that of the Common cold. The virus is endemic now and we will have to live with it as we do with the common cold, flu and other common diseases. People who have vaccinated shouldn't be punished for the actions of the unvaccinated. If I have taken the vaccine, there should be minimal or no restrictions for me. Unvaccinated people should face the consequences of their actions. Not punished by the government but if they fall ill, it's their problem not ours.


3. I don't have to wear a mask when I am outdoors somewhere when it's not crowded. I can understand wearing it at indoor places like stores and malls and schools.


4. If the booster shot is available, I am willing to take it. Though the risk for someone vaccinated with 2 doses is minimal, I see no downsides to a booster. 


5. The virus is not some planned conspiracy. There are two scenarios for its origins. It came from an animal naturally. Disease tends to originate this way. There have been plagues before and plagues will be there in the future. The other way is this was a lab leak from Wuhan. Not that the Chinese leaked it on purpose but due to bad practices it may have leaked from there. Due to the track record of China, I believe this is the most likely and needs more investigation by governments world over. 


5. Governments are using the pandemic to abuse their powers. We all see it. I don't need to elaborate.

1344,‘Covid warrior’ pilot handed ₹85 crore bill for crash landing at airport,"Majid Akhtar, who has 27 years of flying experience, alleged he was not informed of the barrier and demanded an inquiry into why the aircraft was not insured before being allowed to operate. The plane was bought by the state in 2019 and reportedly did not have insurance at the time of the crash.

A charge sheet sent by the state government to Mr Akhtar claimed the aircraft was reduced to scrap due to the crash and had left the state government ₹600m poorer.

Another ₹250m was added as the cost to hire planes from other operators.

1348,Am I responsible for getting severe covid?,"I'm a 23 year old guy, my height is 5'6"" and my weight is 170 lbs (77-78kg). I also have a 38 inch belly. I am a lazy couch potato who moves very little. I also don't go out much due to which I don't get enough sunshine. I am sure my bad habits would have made me immunocompromised. 

During second wave, I got covid from a maskless dude in an auto. I was taking precautions but the other dude wasn't. I was not eligible for vaccines. Nine days later, I got fever and the worst part was that my fever lasted for 12 days nonstop. I started experiencing lung tightness from day 3 and it took over a month to fade away. I had a very low appetite and couldn't hold my breath for more than 6-7 seconds. My oxygen started to dip by Day 8. Many times my saturation levels started from 92-93 and got stable at 94-95. My oxy levels reached 89 just for once. 

I didn't go to hospital or took any oxygen. I healed on my own. I felt like I was hit by a train as I was very weak and crippled. It is very rare for a youngster to get so sick. If I was healthy, lean and active, I would have been asymptomatic or got mild covid.",29,Coronavirus,"Flair_id    8041227c-6517-11ea-b83e-0e7048fc0c5b

1360,Can someone explain how is it constitutional to mandate Aadhar for getting COVID tests done?,"What title says.

From my understanding, the ruling of the 2018 constitutional bench of the supreme court was clear that Aadhar cannot be a mandatory requirement for the provision of goods and services apart from governmental schemes. It specifically clarified that no company or private entity can seek Aadhaar identification from you.

Yet when you go to any lab, even private ones,  to get tested for COVID they will seek Aadhar identification from you. The only other valid ID proof is your passport (likely for foreign travelers), but [given that only 5.15% of Indians have this documentation](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/70-years-of-independence-but-a-passport-remains-out-of-reach-for-95-per-cent/articleshow/59729754.cms), it de facto makes Aadhar mandatory for 95% of the country if they want to access a COVID test. [Mumbai Governor made Aadhar card mandatory for purchasing even self-test kits](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aadhaar-cards-must-to-buy-covid-self-test-kits-from-chemists-in-mumbai-101642237903819.html). During the second wave and even presently chemists would refuse to fill COVID prescriptions without Aadhar card of patient.

What is this madness?

If the goal is identification surely any of the usual KYC documents such as voter ID, DL, employee ID etc. should be sufficient. Why specifically mandate Aadhar? Data is data, and the ICMR should be able to tally tests just fine, as countries around the world do with or without a nationwide ID system.~~^((and do a much better job than India anyways)~~~~)~~

As someone who has reservations about data security I only really use my Aadhar to file ITR (because the courts deemed that mandatory), and try my best to not give it to any private company whatsoever. **AS IS MY RIGHT**. So, If I am privately availing a medical test on my own dime why do I need to mandatorily give max, dr. lal's, my local pathlab, or whoever the fuck my Aadhar credentials?

This is dumb as fuck.

1361,BJP Minister and Delhi riots accused Kapil Mishra is spreading Covid misinformation on far-right anti-vaccine platform Gettr.,"&#x200B;

[https:\/\/gettr.com\/post\/pl9fh21dda](https://preview.redd.it/9b99da0wrtc81.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdef1c8a1b11e20689348171c913d07501041259)

BJP minister Kapil Mishra is spreading lies about Ivermectin claiming it solved UP's Covid crisis. The WHO and the FDA have confirmed that Ivermectin does nothing for Covid, it's a horse dewormer which will cause death and diarrhoea if taken by humans. People have become hospitalised after taking Ivermectin.

\>Some research was “very flawed or even fraudulent,” Khabbaza noted. “Those have been debunked; all the really good studies have not shown a benefit.” (Here’s an in-depth look at one prominent [ivermectin study with serious flaws and inconsistencies](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/ivermectin-covid-study-suspect-data).)

\>The verdict so far is clear: Ivermectin, although it’s still being studied, “has not been found to be effective for the prevention of COVID-19 or the treatment of acute infection once it has developed,” Khabbaza said.

\>Even one of the drug’s main manufacturers, Merck, said in a Feb. 4 statement that there’s “[no meaningful evidence” to suggest ivermectin works](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/) to treat or prevent COVID, and that there’s been “a concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.”

\>However, people have become so convinced that ivermectin is a cheap and readily available “cure” for COVID, they continue to take it against all medical advice and common sense.  People have swallowed potentially toxic and lethal doses of the drug meant to be injected in or poured on cows, sheep, or horses. The Food and Drug Administration even had a tweet go viral in August when it pointed out that people aren’t farm animals.

\>The following side effects and drug interactions that can occur with ivermectin are [signs of ivermectin toxicity](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00449.asp), according to the CDC:

* Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Low blood pressure
* Tachycardia (an abnormally fast heart rate)
* Headache
* Blurred vision and visual hallucinations
* Confusion
* Tremors and loss of coordination and balance
* Seizures
* Central nervous system depression, decreased alertness, and coma

\>Ivermectin can also be dangerous when mixed with drugs that also can suppress the central nervous system, like benzodiazepines and barbiturates. It can sometimes increase the risk of side effects in people taking the blood-thinning drug warfarin.

\>[https://news.yahoo.com/ivermectin-covid-happens-body-202825994.html](https://news.yahoo.com/ivermectin-covid-happens-body-202825994.html)

Mishra's words will influence Indians not to get vaccinated, and instead rely on useless medication which can cause a lot of damage while they spread Covid.

My brother and I are fully vaccinated with Covaxin and we received our 2nd dose in June. Both registrations were made through my number.

However, my brother received an SMS today on his number stating that 2nd dose of Covishield has been administered to him.

Mind you, we reside in Navi Mumbai, MH, and have taken both doses of Covaxin in our city while the Covishield vaccination was done in a rural town in UP.

In the fake certificate (link above), they have somehow managed to get his name correct (maybe they searched on Truecaller) but his age and ID are both incorrect.

Please also look at the batch number mentioned. How is it possible that 2 doses supposedly taken 5 months apart have identical vaccine batch numbers?

The internet tells me that one should wait 6 weeks after recovery before taking the vaccine. That means she will miss her vaccination schedule!

1430,New age startups are another level down in the hellhole,"Okay, this is a rant but also a deeper question lingers within this. Are these new startups actually providing any real value? Or are they really helping/solving problems (as they speak) or is that just a illusion they've made for us and in their minds to just do anything for money?   


I remember when I was in 11th/12th, I used to think to myself that one day all the fraud and conning in the tuition/coaching business will be eradicated by some new company that will have some moral/ethical basis or the whole system would be revamped and only truthful people will remain, and coaching/tuition will again go from business to teaching. BUT BOI I WAS WRONG. ENTER BYJU'S. FRAUD you say? It's 100X now that we're playing on the national level with VC funded money to swing around without any repercussion or ethics. 

Case in point: I have a doctor (dermatologist) in my family. A renowned one. (I was present when this conversation happened)  


Urban Company (previously Urban ladder): Ma'am we're calling to let you know that we're going to offer consultation services on my app, and we'd like you to join us.

Doc: I'm listening.

Urban Company (in short): So the thing is Ma'am, we'll charge 140% of what your consultation fees is and let you have 80% and we'll keep the 60% as brokerage fees? Also, we're offering some dermatological/cosmetological services such as Laser, etc for pimples, acne, etc THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO PUSH THE PATIENT to take.

Doc: Why would I be forgoing my consultation fees when it's really my name that patients would come to you and not the other way around? Also, why would I be pushing treatments to patients who don't need them? I rarely advice cosmetological procedures unless the patient asks or definitely requires. Even then I let them know the pros and cons. Why should I make the patient go for a very costly cosmetological procedure when his condition could be safely and cheaply treated by the correct medication?  


Urban Company: Ma'am these are services that our company is providing and you'll HAVE TO PUSH THE PATIENTS to our centres for these services.   


Doc: I'm not interested. Sorry.

I didn't recharge for a while, I lost the outgoing, then I lost the incoming and basically complete shut off. I did a top up to the main balance just enough to send an SMS to get a porting code, and tried sending one. Doesn't work. 

Huh, weird. So I recharged and got the validity back. Tried again, doesn't work. 

Then I contacted VI and asked why I can't send SMS.

They said I don't have an SMS pack. 

But I did recharge though. 

Well, guess what, not the pack with SMS. 

But, I do have talktime right?

Yes, 16rs.  

Can I use it to send an SMS?

No, lol. 

Well then what can I use it for?

Calls and Data. 

Not SMS? That sounds awfully specific of a choice. But fuck it, can you get me a porting code?

No, you have to generate it from your side. 

But you won't let me use my balance though?

Yeah, you have to recharge for 128 and get an SMS pack.

To send a single SMS?

Yeah. 

And you won't let me use any other way to send an SMS other than get a fucking 1 month 128 rs pack?

Yeah.

1456,Resume mistakes I’ve seen on linkedin,"(note about Templates: MS word has nice ones, you can edit them and change headers too)

1. Using weird colour backgrounds. Green and orange 

2. Your photo is not important. Leave it out I’d say. 

3. Work experience &lt;7 years: 1 page resume; &gt;7y: max 1.5 page

4. No one reads your 4 line career objective. 

5. Inconsistent formatting, making random things BOLD and CAPS. 

&gt;Avoid all caps 

&gt;Avoid Bold and underlining things

6. Skills section: MS excel is not a skill, VLOOKUP, punctuality, time management are not skills either 

7. Client appreciation is not an achievement. 

8. Hobbies - no one cares

9. Declaration - no one cares

10. Father’s name - no one cares

11. Place and signature - shows failure of our education system to keep up. 

(I’m going to keep updating this as I find more, if you want to save it, screenshot it)

Edit: Aah now I get it.

I meant people who know only basic excel shouldn’t put it as a skill. 

VBA, model creation, etc deserve recognition. 

Because people put MS office as a skill too

Edit: people calm down about excel, whichever resume I’ve seen for different reasons - it is obvious the person knows excel through job responsibilities. No need to specify it separately like it’s a special thing like python or R or photoshop. 

Even these can be included in job responsibilities.

These are my POVs. Ofcourse I’m not 100% right about everything. Pick what u like. Ignore what u don’t. And good luck job hunting",723,Business/Finance,"Flair_id    14165a30-316a-11e5-8f83-0ec07e44b9c3

1475,India has almost no Android phone makers that aren't Chinese (except Samsung),"
I've been using my OnePlus 3 for past 5+ years which is still awesome. I thought maybe it's time for a change and started researching about other phones. I'm not an iOS fan. I need my customisation.

I found that there aren't many non-Chinese options. 

The famous Android phone makers that sell in India are OnePlus, Vivo, Oppo, Realme, Motorola, iQOO, Samsung, Redmi, Xiaomi, poco.

OnePlus, Vivo, Oppo, Realme, iQOO are owned by BBK electronics, a Chinese company.

Motorola is owned by Lenovo, a Chinese company.

Redmi, Xiaomi, Poco are owned by Xiaomi, a Chinese company. 

We're only left with Samsung, a Korean company. Google doesn't sell Pixel here anymore. 

Not that I'm against Chinese phones, they're so bloated and possibly no so privacy-safe.

Noticed this with Swiggy and Zomato first. I had some complaints about wrong items getting delivered last year, poor packaging etc. On trying to file a complaint, it was a pretty good experience initially, but then things started going downhill. The only way to get in contact with them was through messages, and as time went on, the responses became slower and resolutions took longer. It took 2-3 hours to ask for a 240₹ refund, when the entire information exchange would have taken 10 minutes or less with a phone call. It was like texting with someone with whom you didn't have a shot, waiting forever for replies and hoping they're not gone forever.

So, O wanted to get in touch with them, and of course once again, there's no way other than messages. Even worse, this time it was emails. So I raised a ticket yesterday, and got a reply today asking for my order number(which they should know, considering they have my account details). Still, I replied with the order ID, and there's been no response since then. I'm losing days and live content on my subscription while I'm waiting for a response.

Hi everyone,

I am working as a freelance software engineer from past 1 year and need some help and advice from you guys.

My  question is, do I need to register a company or proprietorship to carry  out any business as individual? I haven't registered any company or  proprietorship and because of that I don't have any GST number.

However,  please note that as of now, all my sales are outside India so I believe  the GST should not be applicable. But I might be totally wrong.

One  of my friend told me that we need GST and company registration if we  want to work as freelancer and this has got me worried as the financial  year is about to end.

My this years sales is around 22L if that also plays some role in overall scenario?

Please help me and let me know what can be done or the implications of this situation.",2,Business/Finance,"Flair_id    14165a30-316a-11e5-8f83-0ec07e44b9c3

1514,"Why you shouldn't immigrate to Canada, from a Canadian's perspective","Saw some posts here recently talking trash about Canada. As a Canadian (born and raised) who left Canada for India, I wholeheartedly agree. Let me give you my opinion:

&#x200B;

Canada's weather: atrocious. There are only 2 main cities, everywhere else is even colder. Vancouver (raining all the time), and Toronto. Toronto is below zero degrees from December - March, with weather in January and February as low as -20 degrees. Moreover, it will be cloudly for those entire 4 months, very few days of bright sunshine.

&#x200B;

Canada's economy: mediocre. Everything about Canada is just ""mediocre"". Canada does not have the same innovative nature as the U.S. (and in particular silicon valley) has. People just want to coast at a 9-5 job, which are getting more and more competitive because of the flood of immigrants. The job market in Canada sucks compared to the job market in the U.S.. All of my friends growing up who had any dreams in life of doing something meaningful, all left for the U.S.

&#x200B;

Canada's healthcare system: quite good. But it's not ""free healthcare"" (that's the lie that politicians tell you). Canada's ""free healthcare"" system is paid for by one of the highest tax rates in western countries.

&#x200B;

Canada's taxes: this is the biggest problem. Canada's taxes are so high that at the end of the day, there's not much money left for you to save.

&#x200B;

Cost of living: insane. A house in Toronto costs $1-$1.5 million

&#x200B;

Culture: Canada has ""tall poppy syndrome"". It's a culture that strongly discourages people from standing out. Almost like a communist culture. So if you're better than other people, the canadian culture doesn't want you to be better than others. Because you make the mediocre people ""feel bad"".

&#x200B;

Bottomline: if you want mediocrity in your life, go to Canada. If you have an aspirations of doing something meaningful in life (career success) and not just coasting, DO NOT go to Canada.

&#x200B;

Vast majority of indians I've seen in Canada just suffer. Work at Uber, work as secretaries, etc. But each of everyone of them will send messages to relatives back home, saying how great life is in Canada. Because no one wants to admit that they made a mistake.

&#x200B;

I know so many wealthy Canadian friends that left Canada for places with more opportunities (e.g. US), or places with lower taxes (e.g. Dubai). So before you immigrate to Canada, ask yourself this. Why are the successful people in Canada leaving? If the successful people there are leaving, why are you entering?

&#x200B;

I left for India for this very reason. Yes, it sucks being an employee in India. You get paid peanuts. But if you're an entrepreneur, there are SO MANY opportunities in India

1516,I regret coming to go to Canada and it's only been a month since I stepped foot here (The reality of going to Canada as a student),"**Background:**

I tried to leave to Canada for the same reasons everyone tries to leave India, for a better life. I had a small startup company in India which was running well enough for a startup which shutdown when the pandemic hit and one of my partners committed suicide. It, along with a lot of other obvious factors made me want to leave India. I got into a college in Canada with a total fee of 22L for a diploma course and left at the end of October. One thing no one told me about is the housing crisis here and the insane living expenses.

These immigration agencies paint a rosy picture of this life in Canada full of opportunities and wonders where I get to work part-time and pay off my living expenses and student loans while living the best life possible. That can't be further from the truth. My father is a small railway clerk. He gets decent money enough to get me a student loan but that is it. We do not know anyone here in Canada, we have no friends or family here. The only people I know now is the people I met along the way. The college wasn't offering any accommodations and whatever it had was full. I tried looking for rooms and everyone's response here was basically that they'll talk when I'm in Canada. So I booked an Airbnb in Canada for 3 days, hoping to find a room during my stay there and left with a total of 400CAD (24,000rupees) in my hdfc forex card.

**Indians in Canada:**

It soon became clear the kind of people who try to come here mostly consist of wealthy Indians who can more than afford a good lifestyle here. Their parents are wealthy enough to fund them well enough and they also most likely have a family member living here. The second kind are the Indians who have some family member here and can live with them for a while until they can figure things out. People like me who have nothing and no one here are insanely rare and stupid to do something like this without proper financial backing.

Indians here are either the most kindest people you will find or they try to scam you. This one Punjabi guy sold me a 1$ travel adapter for 11$ seeing that I badly needed one while this other Punjabi guy gave me an uber ride of 30$ for free seeing how I was new to the city, both on the first day. Only Indians will scam you and only Indians will be as kind to you as one can be. Seems like there's no in-between.

**Worst day of my life:**

By the third day in Canada, when my Airbnb stay had ended, I had talked to this old lady about renting a room in her place for 1200$ initial deposit and this other guy for renting this other place for the same price. The plan was to go to the bank account and redeem my GIC money of 10,000$, roughly 6Lakh rupees. (which is the initial deposit I have to provide to Canada before I can get the visa), pay the rent and start living there. Things already seemed shaky but I had gone to a nearby bank the day before and they said I needed to have an appointment for that. This day, I had an appointment and I left as early as I can in the day with my total 70kgs of luggage (everything I got from India) to travel 90kms in bus to go to the bank, redeem the money and then take the room. If things go wrong, at least I'd have the money to fall back onto. My father had also sent me 1lakh just incase something goes wrong.

The bus did not stop where it was supposed to. The bus driver drove way past the bus stop when I was clearly asking him to stop and stopped somewhere far away in the next bus stop. It was a minor setback perhaps so I tried to take a bus back again to that stop, waited another half an hour before the bus came and he did the same thing again. He drove back again all over and stopped 2 stops over. Little did I know I had to pull a thin lever tied to either side and unless I do that, he will not stop no matter how much I ask him to. I was very far in another bus stop again. By then, I had dragged my luggage across at least 1km, changed 5 busses and hadn't eaten the whole day. The only ray of hope was to reach the bank somehow and claim the money.

I finally took another bus and somehow reached the bank. The lady, who was also indian, greeted me and then told me she cannot do the procedure to claim my money since it was 3:30 and the bank closes at 4pm. I hadn't gotten the money that my father sent me more than 2 days ago. I had a total of  100$ in my forex card. Apparently the bus service stops early since it was a Saturday, Banks are closed on Sundays, I was way outside the main city and so there aren't many taxi services, the cheapest airbnb costed me 70$ per night. If I book an Airbnb, I wouldn't have money for the uber ride. Even if I did take a bus there, how would I be able to afford the stay for Sunday ?

...

For the first time in my life I couldn't think anymore. I sat at the corner of the bank staring at my dying phone battery wondering what I was doing all the way here on the other side of the planet having left behind everyone who loves me and cares for me. I had everything back home. All my friends and family who could never imagine and can never know that I who would always take them around in my car would be so close to being homeless. I couldn't let them know either because I didn't want them to worry about me.

The bank lady approached me at closing time and asked me if everything is okay. Idk what happened but I couldn't help tearing up. I didn't look at her but I told her I don't know. She asked me if there's someone I can call who can pick me up and I said no. She then asked me if there is somewhere she can drop me and I said no. She asked me to try to find someone I can call. I scurried through my phone contacts to see if there is someone I can call and I found this number of this lady I met the previous day at a government office who told me to call her if I ever got into trouble. I called her up and she gave me another number. I called him up and he didn't answer but he gave me an address. And since I had some address and nothing more to lose, I told the bank lady that I have an address and she told me she will drop me there.

I had no clue where I was going since the text message only contained a name and an address. She drove me and left me on the sidewalk. I went up to the door and knocked. This Indian guy opens the door and asks me what I want. I tell him the name and then he immediately asks me to come in, goes out and carries my luggage inside. There were 5 guys sitting and watching the TV. I start explaining my situation and they ask me to sit down and relax first. This other guy was making dosas and he got me a couple in a plate. Once I had eaten, I told them what had happened and they told me not to worry since I found them and told me how they can crash in their sofa as long as I want to. They were insanely chill. We sat down and watched a movie and right that evening, they took me around in their car and found a room for me that I can rent. And then they sat me down and explained me everything I needed to know. I stayed there for another 2 days until I claimed my money and moved to the new place.

I couldn't be more thankful and its amazing how its always Indians who are truly there for me even though I have never met them ever before. Later I found out that my parents sensed that something was horribly wrong even though I had told them nothing and they hadn't been able to sleep for days until I showed them the room I was going to stay in, especially my father who knew my financial situation and got sick mentally torturing himself for not being able to provide me a better financial support.

&#x200B;

**Rent situation:**

The rent situation is horrible since Canada has the most inflated and expensive housing market on the planet. I am currently paying 500$ (30,000rupees all inclusive) a month for living in a hall in the basement of a house. There are 2 other guys living with me who has their own separate bedrooms since they pay more and the 3 of us have a common bathroom and a common bedroom. All of this in the basement of a house. It may sound pricey but that is kind of the going rate after they got inflated due to the pandemic. I might find a better deal elsewhere but they all get sold out faster than MI flash sale when those were big. But at least I get my little privacy when the other guys don't come this side to use the kitchen that is directly Infront of my hall.

Most Indian students here live in a ""sharing basis"" where they share a bedroom between 2 people that will cost each of them anywhere from 380$ - 500$ (22,000 - 30,000 rupees) a month. And these rooms are most likely in basements along with other such rooms. So in a basement there are often 2-6 students.

I heard of this one rent offer where at the Ground floor there were 8 guys living, on the 1st floor there was 10 guys living and at the basement of a house there were 8 GIRLS living. Sounds crazy but it has become a normal for Indians here. 8 guys/girls in one floor means 4 bedrooms in one floor sharing a common kitchen, hall and a bathroom. It costs 350$ (20,500 rupees) for each person. It got filled in less than a day.

&#x200B;

**Transport:**

A 10km travel will take 9 minutes in a car, 30 minutes in a bicycle and 2 hours in a bus. It is hard to live without a car here. The country is designed for cars. And the busses, you pay about 4$(240rupees) depending on where you are and that will give you a pass that you can use to roam for about 2 hours or less wherever the bus company operates. ~~Yes that's right, there is no government run transport here.~~ This country is a late stage capitalist utopia.

If you want to buy a car, you will get an amazing sedan for cheap. But the monthly insurance can be anywhere from 180$ - 300$ (10,500 - 17500 rupees) a month. The maintenance costs are expensive. Every winter you will have to swap regular tires for winter tires which are expensive.

**Food:**

An egg costs 25 rupees each, cilantro costs 60rupees, tomato costs 70 rupees each and milk costs 105 rupees per liter. Food is very expensive. And so is junk food. This may look manageable but they really add up when you want a proper diet.

**Mobile Internet:**

One thing Indians take for granted is their mobile internet / jio. Mobile plans in Canada cost 50$ (3000rupees) per month for 8GB of data which is standard here and mobile plans aren't universal, they change for each individual costumer. If you can bargain good and find good places (with no Indians scamming you like the Indian who scammed me with my plan), you may find 40$(2400rupees) for 12GB per month which sounds bs compared to the 2GB per day plan you get in jio for 600 rupees per month in india.

&#x200B;

This will all be perfectly manageable since we will be working part-time don't we ?

**Part-time Job situation:**

Well in theory, yes. You can manage all expenses if you work part-time. But it is complicated.

Students get a 20 hour per week work permit. And they all pay minimum wage which is 14.35$/hour (829 rupees/hour) which seems to be the only thing students who come here are looking at. Indian university degree or experience will not be respected in Canada. They don't care who you were in India. They only offer minimum wage, take it or leave it. But even that for 20 hours a week should give around 1000$ (60,000rs) per month minus the travel expenses right ? Well that is if you can find a job that will give you full 20 hours. I got a job that is only paying me 12 hours a week which adds only up to 600$ (36,000rs) a month of which 500$ is going for rent.

The jobs that give full 20 hours often involve manual labor like lifting weights of up to 20kgs frequently. It is basically the lowest job there can be in this country. They may even pay a little more that minimum wage but they are often in far off locations that consume money in transport. Indians can totally do that but that still is not enough since the food+rent will take up all the money. And unexpected expenses keep pouring in unannounced.

So too many Indians work for ""cash jobs"" after the finish their main job which is basically illegal work that is paid in cash so the government cannot track it, which is often dangerous as you can guess and a some even get scammed. But this has become the normal. Main job + Cash job is what one needs to survive and manage expenses and have some savings too.

So basically whatever time the college takes + 20 hours of cash job + 20 hours of main job and the rest of the time you're too tired to do anything else.

&#x200B;

**Canadians:**

Canadians are extremely polite. They are very very nice people in general but they also seem paranoid of other people. Indians don't really mix with the Canadians very easily. They stay separate and in their own circles and I understand why.

**Depression:**

Students here can't and won't tell the struggles they face here to their parents or even their friends back home. The pictures of them posing in these pristine streets and behind expensive cars does not show a true picture of what's happening here to them. Living in basements and working factory or minimum wage jobs after living a good life in India and away from loved ones is not going to be good for anyone's mental health. Indian students ""get used to"" whatever happens here.

&#x200B;

**And then what after getting a PR ?**

Work insanely hard, hustle, finish college, get a job after college, go head over heels to get a PR and then what ?

I live very far away from the city and in this tiny town where I had a lunch with a kind Canadian family of 5 who was paying a rent of 2400$ (1.4Lakh) per month for a small basic decent house. And they tell me how they are struggling to make ends meet. And the houses here start at 5 crore rupees all the way out here in this tiny town and you can guess the city prices. Unless one gets a VERY GOOD job here or has rich parents, buying a house here seems impossible. Apartments don't really cost that much less. In contrast, the 200sq.yard duplex house I lived in the city back home, had a rent of 10,000 rupees (170$) per month. The rent I'm paying here will get me a luxury apartment in the center of the city back home.

I personally cannot imagine living in a country where I will need both mine and my spouse's income combined just to live a decent life and still always be at the risk of going homeless any day. The land prices at the outskirts of my city was costing 24lakhs for 200sq.yards right before I left. I cannot imagine life where in a city where basic commodities can be a struggle.

In India the wages may be low. But the if half your income is goes for accommodation, you'd be able to buy the house instead if renting it. My father pays 1/6th of his income for accommodation. And an average salary of 30,000rs per month like mine paying 8000rs for a full house rent, still left about half my salary for savings which could do a lot in Indian economy.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

The cars may not be as cheap, the roads may not be as pristine (although that's slowly changing), the house may not be made of wood, the trees may not come in red color, the street selfies may not help parents brag and the roadside people may not be as polite. But I will have my self respect and mental health.

Being in India is not easy but it's worse out here unless you're loaded, you have an amazing job or your dad's a politician or something. I think about my family a lot and friends that I left behind to pursue what exactly? The pandemic pushed me and a lot of others to despair and we thought coming here would solve something. Canada saw a record intake of Indians this year and I imagine lots of them were pushed to despair by the pandemic like I was.

India is an amazing country despite all its negative political bs. My asthma inhaler costs 140 rupees in India, 1800 rupees in Canada and 17000 rupees in US apparently. India heavily subsidizes medicines that I have always taken for granted like most other Indians. Food is very cheap and road side food is ultra cheap while being delicious. People may not be as polite but they are real. Internet is surprisingly the cheapest on the planet. Literally everything is cheap and not just that, one gets to live a dignified life with loved ones.

&#x200B;

Post Note:

This post does not apply to anyone who is rich or has a good job. Most Indians aren't very rich. Middle class Indians often seem to look at the rich Indians here and come here searching for that life. A lot of times, it's the taxes paid by the hard earning Indian public that got them that Lamborghini.

&#x200B;

Edit 1:

1. Of course I wasn't prepared for this. Anyone with two braincells can see that. I don't want to be reminded of how unprepared I was. And I came to Canada with only 400$ because that's all my father could afford to give me at that time. We are poor. It was either go now or lose the 10lakh fee I paid. It's really hard to be prepared when poor.
2. The nuances and the intricate details are hard to research online. Like how was I supposed to know I have to pull that thin rope placed in the corner of the bus off of google ? How does one search for these things ?
3. I never said I'm smart, I said I was desperate. Desperation makes people make stupid decisions. When life seems to be falling apart rapidly, the first instinct is to try to fix it anyhow. Mistakes have been made.
4. I am well aware of the costs way before coming here. I'm trying to inform others. Also it's one thing to know the costs beforehand and another to actually buy groceries at that cost.",6958,Immigration,"Flair_id    683fec48-6656-11ec-9e51-aa8b9f7eb4a1

1523,Does anyone here have experience living in Sweden or Spain? Need advice,"I have 2 job offers - 1 from Malaga (Spain) and another from Stockholm (Sweden). I wanted to know if anyone from India has experienced living in these locations and understand their experience - like the pros and cons of living there, etc.

This would help me in making a decision.

Update-

I'm adding more details:

 I'm 30M, a front-end developer with 7+ years of experience and currently, I have 2 job offers - one of 45000 EUR annually for Malaga and another of 55000 SEK monthly (62000 EUR annually) for Stockholm.

I've wanted to move out for a few years now, and really wanted to move to a European country so this feels like a great opportunity. However, I'd like to make an informed decision and, therefore, seek advice from the community.

I've never lived in another country for a long time, just traveled to 3 countries (max stay - 2 weeks in Thailand). I have extremely basic knowledge of Spanish, and zero knowledge of Swedish.

Following are some of the factors that I'm considering-

1. Climate - I read that Sweden gets too cold and Spain too hot. I prefer winters to summers as long as they aren't extreme.
2. Career progression - Would like to have a lot of choices to switch jobs in the future so a location with a large number of tech companies is preferred.
3. I'd like to gain citizenship in a European country in the near future. (From what I read, it takes 5 years in Sweden and 10 in Spain by naturalization).
4. Food - I've been a lacto-ovo-vegetarian most of my life, and only recently started eating meat (mostly fried) so prefer a location with a good amount of vegetarian options.
5. People - I'm an introvert and it's a bit hard for me to talk to new people so I'd like to stay somewhere it's comparatively easier to make friends. (I'm into video games and traveling.)
6. Ease of doing stuff - like getting a driver's license (still haven't learned driving a car properly lol), etc. So bureaucracy, but also about private services like food delivery.
7. Safety - Lower crime rates, racism, etc.
8. Ability to bring parents later.
9. Anything else that I haven't considered but might be useful to know.

1. Citizenship
2. Food

What I’ve found is that majority of indian people I ended up friends with are so transactional, using you till they benefit and move on. I’m not talking about one or two people here. I had a circle with desi community and others but mostly desis turned out to be the worst. It was hurtful and disappointing.

1525,Should I stay in America?,"At the young age of 18, I came to the US for college and it was so difficult for me to transition to life here as an international student. Before coming here, I looked down on India and all I saw were the negatives. But after moving to the US, I began to appreciate Indian values of community and communal living but I still liked the US better. Fast forward to COVID and I went back to India for a year (took a gap year from my American college) as a semi-adult (still living with my parents but working in India) and I absolutely loved it. I worked in a startup in Bengaluru and everyone was so warm, welcoming, and I felt a genuine sense of community. 

Post-COVID, I'm back in the US to finish my college degree but I don't enjoy life here as much anymore. All I see are superficial conversations and superficial social connections. It feels like people are not interested in me and I don't feel a sense of community. Even as a college student, it feels like professional growth here is prioritized above everything else, especially social connection. I'm graduation soon and do have a job lined up for me in the US (I will be working on the STEM OPT) which I feel like I should take to make my American college education, specifically the money that was spent on my college tuition, worth it. But I don't feel happy or at home here. I feel like I could move back to India in a few years but I'm worried about the opportunity cost of these few years and what I'm missing out on (a sense of comfort, community, and belonging). I'm worried that if I wait too long, I won't have a community in India either. I recognize that I'm in a very privileged position - both in the US and in India.

1530,IELTS is easy with right attitude ( 8 bands ),"I hope this information is useful for IELTS aspirants. 
.
So I had my IELTS on 13th November 21. 
In one month of self-preparation ; I scored 8 bands. 
8.5 R ; 8.5 L ; 7.5 W and 7 in Speaking. 
.
The most positive thing about IELTS is...
It doesn't have a freaking syllabus. 
It's just an exam that measures your English level and since it's a standardized test ; It follows certain marking pattern. If you understand those, you can manipulate them to get as high score. 
.
I will write how I tackled each module and how I manipulated and took advantage of it's loopholes. 
.
.

.
**Listening** :-  

So if you are preparing ; I'm sure that you know listening is the easiest module. It is a score booster if you are good at it. 
In listening they'll just talk and you've to follow the conversation. In order to do it perfectly ; you should always read all the questions in tiny gaps that they give you inbetween the conversation. 
If you already understand the question ; you'll know the answer the moment they speak. You'll be alerted very quickly. 
Also try to not get distracted while writing the answer. For me I when I was writing the answer of one question they spoke the other answer and I didn't catch it. Thus 8.5 bands. ( I was certain to get 9 ) 
.
.
.

.
**Speaking** :- 


Speaking is really really hard to improve in short time.
If you have more than 5-6 months ; You can improve significantly but in one month's time it's really hard ! 
But you can Manipulate it's marking system to your advantage. 
In speaking ; what you need to do is MEMORIZE chunks of sentences. 
Let me give you an example. 
"" Ahemdabad is a metropolitan city with over 10 million population"". 
"" It is a shopper's paradise""
"" Ahemdabad is booming with is industries, culture and it's vibrant festivals "" 
"" Most of the residents like in the outskirts of the city and the heart of the city is shopper's paradise""
"" Ahemdabad is renowned for it's exquisite cuisine ""
"" There is a glorious lake behind the backyard of my house and everytime I see it ; My heart gets filled with joy and My eyes, with tears"" 
Etc etc. 
.
So if you can remember these types of sentences than you don't have to make sentences out of your head. You can speak them. 
I'm not telling you to remember the answers of questions that's a bad idea. I'm telling you to remember chunks of sentences ; that you can use to give your answer with Fancy English. 
.
Okey now in Part 2 :- speaking part two is hardest right ? They have a lot of weird topics. 
How the fuck am I gonna describe a cafe when I haven't been to one for my entire life ! 
So in part 2 ; The manipulative trick is.....
DIVERSION.
 speak about something that you know about...
And join it to your answer. 
Let me give you an example :- 
So in cafe question.....
You can speak about your city for like 70-80 seconds and join it by saying that
""My city is very famous for it's cafe. There are multiple exquisite cafes with various themes but amongst all I really love Coffe Cafe day."" 
Just like this ! 
And also make sure to answer all three questions that are in your que card. 
.
Btw My speaking skills are mediocre. 

.
.

.
**Writing** :- 

Report :- what I learnt about report writing is ; Your entire report has to be about comparing the information. And contrasting it. 
The more you confuse the reader while writing on accurate points to the data, The higher you gonna get. Really ! 
If you are preparing from Cambridge Books ; Please please Please ; I cannot stress this enough, 
READ THE FUCKING EXAMINER'S NOTES ON BACK OF THE BOOKS ( answer section ) 
It will clarify so much. Really. 
Also Try to remember atlist 10 synonyms for Increase-Decrease. It's a must !!!!!


.
**Essay** :-

 oh damn ! There are countless essays, so for God's shake do not remember the fucking essays!
We indians have been taugh to do cramming for almost out entire fucking life ! But if you cram here ; You are fucked ! 
Now that said ; Let me give you an idea how you can tackle this portion. 
.

.
So download lots and Lots of model essays and try to copy them. 
What I mean by that is ; Try to understand how that person had written the essay ; How he has presented the ideas and how structured his essay is. 
Try to remember-copy it. And make that style your own. You've to right atlist 20-30 essays if you wanna get good at it. If you're good writer than Yey ! You don't need to ! 
Anyway Most important thing is try to understand complexe sentences and how you can write it.

.

.
**vocabulary** :- when it comes to vocab ; People are really scared. If you think that you're gonna need 200-300 newwords and you are memorizing that many words for your exam ; Well you're stupid ! You don't need that many words and you will not be able to use that many words anyway. 
On exam day ; anxiety will definitely be there. Just like toxic and obsessed ex ! 
.
What my advice is ; To remember only 50 words. 50 really fancy words ! And use than in exam. Since it's only 50 you'll easily remember it on exam too and try to use em all in writing or speaking too. Your essay will look really good. 
.
.

.
Now let's talk about Final Boss. the Devil. 

.
**Reading**

Whoever designed this module ; Well I hope they go to hell ! 
This is the module that really brings out tears in eyes. 
.
Okey now let's talk how to tackle it. Firstly ; you will need incredible hard work and smart practice in this module. I think of reading as a hardcore Hide and seek. Answer is hiding and you have to seek it. 
Well ; what my advice is ; Everytime you can't find the answer ; Try to notice how The answer was hidden. 
Try to analyse what you were doing wrong. And do not repeat same mistakes....
Everytime you make mistake ; try to analyse it and than don't do it again. It's that simple. 
It really requires patience but you can slowly improve in it too. 
.
My starting score was 26/40 and than I got 30/40 than 35/40 and than 37/50. On real test I got 8.5 bands. And You can do it too. 
.
.
.
One more thing ; Try to solve paper in 50 minutes. That is a must. At first it'll require like 90 minutes but time will slowly decrease as you practice more. 
I was able to complete entire reading in 40 minutes by the time my Test was near. And in exam I solved it on 45 minutes. I had time to double check everything. 
.
.
.

Now final Verdict :- 
Firstly damn ! This is a long post but if it helps you like 1% than my 1 hour spend on writing this is totally worth it. 
Well, My fellow brother or sister ; 
Whoever you are or where ever you're reading this from ; Remember this :- IELTS is a bitch. Don't let it bite you. Make it your bitch ! It's that simple. 
.
Best of luck for your exam.",83,Immigration,"Flair_id    683fec48-6656-11ec-9e51-aa8b9f7eb4a1

1532,Please don't get greedy about immigrating to Canada.,"Only immigrate to Canada

-if you have sufficient funds based on the city you want to live in. Just because you meet the proof of funds requirement does not mean that you can live in the costliest cities in Canada. If you need to take loans then don't even consider coming to Canada. 

-if you have great work experience working for multinational corporations. Unfortunately, a lot of companies in Canada don't really count on Indian work experience. 

-if you are able to communicate with others in English. Unfortunately, it is known a lot of students/immigrants from India were able to cheat through the English examination and they simply could not able to communicate with people who speak English. 

-You are good at getting recertified with your profession. Unfortunately have known several engineers and doctors from India failing the certification exams in Canada. I was told that it is way difficult compared to what students were tested in universities in India. 

https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/12/08/400-students-in-india-told-to-retake-language-tests-after-niagara-college-flags-concerns.html#:~:text=Niagara%20College%20has%20contacted%20more,losing%20their%20offer%20of%20admission. 

-if you are a student, please go to a college or university that is reputable. Unfortunately, a lot of students are taking their own lives due to stress and lack of job prospects. Plus they take student loans. 
https://newcanadianmedia.ca/recent-deaths-by-suicide-of-indian-international-students-point-to-disturbing-trend/ 

it was only recently that the Canadian government has become stricter about study permits. 

Tips

-Cities like, Toronto and Vancouver do not need immigration. Consider going through other provinces where they desperately need immigration. Housing is a huge issue in those cities. 

Also if you won the provincial nomination, you better work in that province otherwise you will have trouble getting Canadian citizenship. Saying PR has a right to move across the provinces won't help avoid the charge for misrepresentation. 

-Actually, visit Canada before immigrating and make sure you really want to come here. Canada is an amazing place to live in but also much costlier than India and the median wages are low. 

Source-I have studied in Canada aka UofT, worked in Canada, came back to India worked here, and now recently immigrated to Canada. My work experience in India did not improve my resume and my work experience in Canada helped me to get interview opportunities.  


Please just because you have the opportunity to immigrate, please think about it carefully before you do. Have known several immigrants either being debt trapped, unemployed, working for odd jobs, and be extremely depressed. 

if you have any questions, feel free to ask me. 

Take care.

Edit: 

Lmao a lot of people think that I am trying to limit competition lol. 

My advice is for folks who think that immigrating and living in Canada is easy and make a lot of money. 

Regarding the loans, alright, I tend to be biased against loans because I have seen several students to be under pressure because of it and taken their own lives. Posts like this are becoming common https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/qriyx8/how_to_pay_for_uoft_without_parents_help/ . 

Another article here where there is a rise of pressure for students who are under debt https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/students-from-india-face-lots-of-challenges-in-canada-experts-101636635626516.html 

Its gotten so bad there are charities for them. http://sunohcharity.com/causes.php 

But regardless i would take back my word and instead say you have to think very carefully on loans.",540,Immigration,"Flair_id    683fec48-6656-11ec-9e51-aa8b9f7eb4a1

I feel I'm qualified to answer these questions as I have either worked in many of these countries or have close family/friends living/working in them.

My background, I did my BTech from a so called ""tier 1"" prestigious college in India, then moved to US to do my PhD at a top 3 school .

3). Scope for higher education.
4). Ease of immigration.
5). Culture
6). Salaries
7). General outlook of people on immigration and immigrants.

10). According to specific circumstances is it better to stay in India or imigrate.
11). Comparison of two or more countries on some specific parameters.
12). Anything else that is important and not super specific to individual conditions or has a lot of technicalities.
13). Standard of living.

Don't ask questions regarding the legal process involved in immigrating to a specific country or specifics about different visas or permits.

Because I already have one, I'm assuming not, but they get renewed when you turn 20 and you have to keep passport photos up to date untill 50.

1540,I have lost my first job abroad and I don't know what to do with my life,"Hello everyone,

I'm an Indian woman who moved to Europe for my bachelor's in 2012. I graduated with a Master's in 2019 and my life has been downhill ever since. Firstly it took me a long time to finish my degree as I had to work and support myself. I had a job I was supposed to start in 2020 March that was cancelled due to covid. I managed to stay one more year by enrolling myself as a student. In this time I got some kind of student engineer position for 3 months and another internship this year in September for a month. Both companies did not want to hire me due to complex bureaucracy in this country with hiring non EU.

The past two years took a big toll on my mental health. There was another company in between that offered me a contract only to withdraw it last minute because Immigration did not know how long work visa would take. I did not have the mental capacity any more after all of these rejections plus had a hard life past year where I had to work 2 jobs as a dishwasher to be able to pay my rent. So I decided to fly back to India. 

Sadly this country took years and my positive outlook out of me. I'm 29 right now and I really don't know what to do next. I have two engineering degrees from a reputable European university ( it is in top 10 in Europe) but simply no proper job experience ( only internships as an engineer). Due to the amount of racism and xenophobia I have experienced in this country, I'm trying to look at other options.

It is a bit difficult for me going back to live in India due to non stop family drama and them wanting me to get married asap. I have no interest in relationship or getting married that often causes conflict with my family. 

I really don't know what to do at this point. What are my chances at moving to somewhere more immigrant friendly like Canada or Australia? Any suggestions are welcome.

1543,Need some help deciding between Ireland and Canada. Please help/guide me professionals in these countries!,"I'm a marketer based in India. I have about 4 years of digital marketing experience working with brands across different sectors. My experience includes a mix of content, social and paid marketing. 

I have three goals - Gain a master's, get a job abroad and eventually find a way to immigrate permanently. 

However I'm in a huge dilemma right now - 

1. Ireland - Beautiful country, weather seems okayish and much better compared to canada, student visa process seems a little easier compared to canada. I'm planning to do a masters in business analytics and find an entry level job in the country which will eventually allow me to work my way up to gain the critical skills permit within the 2 years of stamp 1G. Atleast i hope! 

Pros - I believe analytics is a field that is growing and the demand for professionals in this industry will grow in different countries. It will open more doors for me professionally. Very low financial investment for my masters compared to Canada. The uni I've gotten into is very well recognised. 

Cons - Obtaining citizenship does seem like a more challenging process compared to Canada. The ongoing housing crisis and increasing expenditure. 

2. Canada - Good country again. However if i have to choose canada il have to forego my plan of doing a specialised masters and choose a general management degree like an MBA or global management program. I don't know how much value this would add to my overall profile. Im not sure how much experience would play a factor into me finding a job after graduation. 
Also recently IRCCs new memo states that FSW and CEC  processing times may go up to 36 months which is a bummer and also there is a dearth of Indian students moving to canada to settle there. I'm not quite sure how i feel about that. 

Pros - The PR process seems a little more straightforward compared to Ireland. Ideally if i complete a master's, and if i like living in canada, i would want to apply for a PR after 3 years of being on the PGWP. Most people do get it through this route. 

Cons - I also think a general mba would not really help me stand out amongst candidates. As far as the people I've spoken to, they've told me that I would have to start from an entry level job. High cost of living and rent and also the housing crisis. Also tution fees are exhorbitant for a master's degree from an unrecognised institution. The weather sucks.

Please help me decided between the two. I feel like I'm stuck?",1,Immigration,"Flair_id    683fec48-6656-11ec-9e51-aa8b9f7eb4a1

1547,Need advice with MBA abroad. UK/Canada,"Hi I am looking to pursue MBA most likely from UK. I have applied as well in some good public universities in UK. I have a good academic background as well as few years of experience. I had made up my mind totally for UK since the MBA there is also of one year as compared to two years in Canada. 

A few days ago I had call with a distant relative over this topic. She was totally against the UK. The reasons she citied were, hard to get PR, strict 20 hours/week work time, and the said the job market in Canada is better. 

I am now very much confused. 
My requirements are: 

1. I want to stay back at-least for a few years (5-10) so that I am able to get a good return on investment on my MBA as well as get good work experience and save well. And I am open to settle permanently as well if there is an opportunity. So not necessarily getting a PR is not a deal breaker for me. But I should be able to stay back and work for some time.

2. Canada’s weather haunt me. 

3. I am not looking to making loads of money while I am studying. I want to focus on my grades. The money should be enough to pay my rent and expenses while I study. 

4. Career opportunities. 

5. I am okay with the culture of either countries. Since there is a big Indian diaspora in both. Also I have some relatives in London. And distant relatives in Canada. So that’s a non issue. 

I would like to hear your advice on this. If you are already living there or have been there, please share your insights.",1,Immigration,"Flair_id    683fec48-6656-11ec-9e51-aa8b9f7eb4a1

1551,Chennai Customs (sea shipment),"Hello all! I moved back to India from USA back in September 2021. I sent 6 boxes of my stuff through Universal Relocation by sea. It arrived and was unloaded from the container at Chennai port around 15-16th December. I am yet to receive my boxes. I have been waiting patiently but it's been way too long.

When I reached out to Universal Relocation, they said that it's still in customs and that I can do nothing but wait. Has anyone else had similar issues lately? Are the Chennai customs usually this slow ? Or should I be worried about them missing my boxes? Is there a contact number for Chennai customs that I can call and get some information?


Any help or advice would be appreciated! TIA!

Edit: the relocation company said that Customs have been really slow because of a COVID spread in the office and an increase inspection alert at certain ports and hence taking longer than expected.

1560,"Need suggestions for viable migration options to developed nations, for a small business owner","Hello fellow redditors. With the curent political scenario in the country and the collective intellect of country taking a different direction over the last few years, I'm starting to have doubts if I want to raise a child and that too a female child in this country. I was looking for some guidance for ways to migrate to a more developed and culturally diverse nation with good educational institutions. My Target is to successfully start earning in a developed nation in the next 3-4 years so that the schooling of my child starts there.

Obvious candidates are Canada, New Zealand and USA. I'm not sure about European countries. Britain doesn't seem much accepting to Indians in the long term. Other countries have language barriers. I'm open to suggestions.

Personal Background:
I'm a Mechanical Engineer who has been in my family business in logistics for the last 10-11 years. I'm 33 male. Not given IELTS ever. English writing and listening skills are alright. Spoken english is not so fluent as I haven't had any practise. Wife is undergraduate with basic English skills. She is currently a home maker.

Monetary Background:
Depends on the time available to gather funds but can manage upto 1 CR given a year or two to accumulate. 

Migration Route Options:

Study:
I'm decently quick learner. Have over the past year learnt coding and have developed a webapp for my company's internal use. So I am ready to take the study route and do some course in computer science to get into the tech field. 

Work:
As I'm a small business owner, I have to handle everything from sales, operations to accounting. Getting a specialised kind of job with 2-2.5 lacs salary in India will be a difficult task for me considering the generalised experience that I have. So it would be even more difficult to get a job in a foreign country with my current experience and skill set.

What are my best options to be able to successfully immigrate to a developed nation? I'm open to all options.

Tldr; Need suggestions for viable migration options for a small business owner in India. BE Mech with 10-11 years business experience. No job experience.",0,Immigration,"Flair_id    683fec48-6656-11ec-9e51-aa8b9f7eb4a1

I want to emigrate because honestly, I don't wish to stay in India long-term because of health and workplace infrastructure mostly. Healthcare here is unreliable and expensive, and work life balance is non-existent. 

I've been trying to look at options in terms of countries, but I'm confused about where to start. I know there are tons of companies that help people emigrate, but I don't want to fall into some shady deal honestly. 

I'm also wondering how easy it is to get a job in another country from India - I'd rather not go as a student and wait for luck to work while I wait for a permanent/work visa. I did that in the UK and it was disappointing to have multiple rounds of interviews just to be told that they won't sponsor my visa. 

I've been told that some countries have co-op programs where you can study and work and have the company pay for your visa/tuition. Are those any good? 

Any and all advice will be appreciated. 

Contrary to username, not actually lawless or jobless. I've about 5 years of experience in Marketing-adjacent field and I'm not in a hurry honestly. I'd rather get a good position than take a rash decision.

1577,My take about immigrating to canada as a student... immigrating to canada,"Okay so people have been saying there are alot of problems if you immigrate to canada and damn right there are , there will be problems , show me a place where there are no problems and I'll be hesitant to move there . What I can do is trade some problems for others , thats what we do in life right ? Trade childhood problems with adult problems , adult problems with old age problems. 
Now , india has a very peculiar set of third world problems we all know about like 

corruption , corruption , did i mention corruption ?
 Politians are illiterate , people who are related to these illiterate corrupt politians think they are above law 
women are harrased regularly , people think it's okay to rape , so many politians and spiritual gurus have rape cases against them  a day doesn't go by where i don't have to worry about my girlfriends safety 
 my friends Scotty crashed because street dogs ran after him , a road got jammed because of a cow 
Competition for jobs is too much , jobs are too less
Aqi is going to shit 
If i go to a municipal department building , it's like a tradition to take atleast 500rs with me so i can bribe to get the work done
And so many more problem.

Now in canada most of these problems don't exist but problems that other posts have stated do exist and i am not denying them. It's just personally i would choose to face a first world countries problem over India's problems but that's just me.

Also it highly depends on the route you are taking to canada , if you are studying in a reputed university in a city with jobs and in a field like computer engineering , then you'll have a lot more chances to make it there.

So yes , Canada is worse of course it is but i don't think these posts should be telling you if you should try or not , do your own research. Figure out if you will make it on your own , you are a big boy now.",0,Immigration,"Flair_id    683fec48-6656-11ec-9e51-aa8b9f7eb4a1

I know she's done loads of research about all this, and she's really passionate about the ""migrating to Australia"" part, but I wanted to know real people's experiences, just to see if it's a realistic dream and I could tell her about everything I've discovered.

So, if there's anyone with a similar dream and more experience, or anyone who's had that dream and has succeeded/failed, please do tell me about your experience, and give some advice to my dearest cousin",0,Immigration,"Flair_id    683fec48-6656-11ec-9e51-aa8b9f7eb4a1

1597,"Hi I am moving to Halifax, Canada in February 2022. I need some serious help!","Hey, I work for an MNC and I am immigrating to Halifax, Canada in February of this year. I need some help regarding this. 
Previously, I have lived in London, UK for a period of 2 years, in 2016. But I recently got a job in a Canadian company and I plan to settle in Canada. I have a work permit and a visa. My wife will be going with me,

I need help with the following things:

## Need a Place to Stay:

First off, I need a place to stay in Halifax, Canada. The neighborhoods that I am interested in (in my order of preference) are Clayton Park, Bratford and Downtown. I am looking for a 1BHK place. Preferably furnished with Bed, Sofa, Shelves/Storage/Wardrobes etc. We can manage if its not. An extra separate room for home office would be preferable since I will be working remotely for the foreseeable future. My budget is $1000-$1200. Is that budget enough for those neighborhoods and my preferences?

Is it possible to find and decide on a house while I am here in India or should we get there first and then stay at an AirBnB or a hotel and then look for houses? Which one of these is safer?

Also since I don't have a PR yet, can I plan to buy a house there in the near future?

## What stuff should I pack? 

From what I know, Halifax is extremely cold. What should I pack? My main concerns are clothes and utensils. For example, will we both freeze like popsicles while traveling from the airports to our place of stay?

### Utensils

We have heard that its harder for people to acquire a pressure cooker, pots, rolling pin, ladles, and appliances like grinders, etc in Canada. Its either smaller in size or very pricey or unavailable. And appliances from India won't work there.

My wife even looked at https://www.amazon.in/Pigeon-Stovekraft-Belita-Anodized-4-Pieces/dp/B00JWMTZ3U/ (a multi 3in1 cooker by Pigeon) to save space in luggage but then we heard that it's not of a good quality. 

Some videos on YT also suggested to pack Maggi and Masalas, etc. but should we? 

Homemakers in Canada, please sound off here.

### Clothes

Clothes are our greatest fear since they can take up quite a sizeable space in our luggage and we don't want to carry anything that won't be helpful there. Should we buy any winter clothes here? What should we pack? Should we go there and buy? Should we buy at the airport? What brands should we buy?

Besides these, What else should I do or pack? Is there something that we are not considering right now which might become  a concern later? Any help or recommendations which can help with our travel and living there would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.",0,Immigration,"Flair_id    683fec48-6656-11ec-9e51-aa8b9f7eb4a1

Another question. In return, my flight is on Sunday at 5 am, and I am thinking to get the PCR test done on Friday morning. Is it too late? I don't know how long it takes to get the results back in India. Do I need to get any other tests before the flight on Sunday for return?

1606,Lost my job abroad. Has anyone in similar situation made a career switch to IT?,"Hello everyone,

I am the OP of this post
https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/qlzl72/i_have_lost_my_first_job_abroad_and_i_dont_know/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Firstly, I would like to thank you all for the support and advice you sent me. 

A lot of commenters talked about the numerous job opportunities within the IT sector as compared to ME. As I am back in India and have a lot of free time on my hands, I have been considering picking up some IT skills. Doing a full Master's program in computer science for 2 years abroad isn't possible for me anymore due to financial situation. So I was wondering if anyone knows of a legible short program or online courses on programming? 

With my last post, I came to know about some companies in the EU, that offer training/ bootcamp in coding and if you are competent hire you. As I am a bit more interested in immigrating to Canada, I was wondering about whether there are any IT companies in Canada that offer something similar?

Also, I live in a pretty noisy street in India with a big ( and loud) family and pretty bad internet. Due to all this it is next to impossible to do an online job interview at my place. I tried to go to an internet café before for an interview but had the same noise and bad internet issues due to which the interviewer had to call it off. How did you guys manage with online interviews being in a situation like this?",8,Immigration,"Flair_id    683fec48-6656-11ec-9e51-aa8b9f7eb4a1

It's more like a casual annual conference so VISA would be B-1. The US based company who is organising this conference will be paying for the trip.

With all that out for the context. My question is if I apply for VISA by next week, do I have any chance of getting that VISA approval before last week of November?

I don't need to be there for more than 3 days. But, I'm worried whether I can make it in time for it?

Also, with a pandemic going on, are they even processing non-immigration VISA? Because I read that they started dropbox-VISA's few weeks/months back.",7,Immigration,"Flair_id    683fec48-6656-11ec-9e51-aa8b9f7eb4a1

1610,To those of you who've experienced living in either Canada or UK(or both :D)? How is your Career and living standard compared to India? What are the pros and cons of the country you live in?,"I'm planning to go for a PG diploma in Canada but I'm really confused about which country should I go(UK OR CANADA) or should I just stay in India. I'm a software engineer and expected to earn around a lack/month around next year with pretty much 80% of the salary saved so my main reasons of leaving the country is to have different social and cultural experiences. 

Getting a PR in Canada would be easy but I've heard that job market in Canada isn't too good compared to other countries like UK, USA, Germany etc. My friend who's living in Ottawa also horrified me by saying he's expected to earn around 35k CAD after graduation and there just isn't free time to do anything. That sounded very depressing to me. Spending lakhs on education in a different country away from family and barely surviving. This made me wonder about the job opportunities in Canada as I've heard a lot about how there's a sort of racism in terms of Canadians not considering foreign experience/ education at all. 

I think this post is going everywhere but I wanted to know what country would you choose for education, working and possibly immigration if you wanted to choose between Canada and UK. Thanks :D",2,Immigration,"Flair_id    683fec48-6656-11ec-9e51-aa8b9f7eb4a1

1627,Indian English to Avoid in the USA,"Working in IT, I hear a lot of Indian English. Here's some phrases to avoid while working with your American colleagues. 

- Do the needful: This phrase implies that I know WTF you want. It also is insulting, presumptuous and condescending. All I really NEED to do is die and pay taxes. 

- Please revert: Revert means to return to an earlier state as in ""Please rollback the code and revert to release 1.1"". Instead use ""Please reply"".

- Take a system dump: Do you mean download the server logs and figure out what's wrong with my crappy software? Yeah, right after my system takes a dump.

- Out of station: Just say ""I'm going home"".

- Do one thing: and then rattle-off 10 tasks. Wait, you said ONE thing. This is my favorite.

- Updation: What the heck? Is that even a word? Just say ""update"".

Best luck dealing with Americans.

Edit 1: I quit. You guys win. Please do the needful.

Edit 2: Guys settle down. None of these phrases are grammatically incorrect. I never said that. What they are is an archaic holdover from when the British ruled your country. Plus no one outside India and IT knows what they really mean. For example, ""out of station"" would be taken literally as in you are standing outside the train station. Furthermore, why in the world would you'd want to continue using the outdated language of your oppressors? Tell me that.

Edit 3: Great discussion, guys. I want to thank everyone who contributed, even Pubes. Although we weren't always cordial, I still enjoyed the thread and I learned a lot. This is how we understand and accept other cultures. Also, thank you to the mods who let this thread run. Live long and prosper. Your American friend, Metro.

Addendum: A few comments brought up some more words that don't mean what you think they mean. They are perfectly good words, but don't use them in the USA unless you really mean it.

- Rubber: instead use eraser unless you're having sex.

- Florida Man: a Florida Man is a crazy, stupid, meth head, dirty white trash criminal that always gets caught. Crime is everywhere, Florida has the weirdest criminals despite having the harshest law enforcement.

- Pass Out and Got Off: again, perfectly acceptable as in ""I passed out at Holi, but damn I got off on bhang, ganja and charas.

- Money Shot: Perfectly acceptable, but don't say it unless you're watching porn.",762,Science/Technology,"Flair_id    40e5c9b0-316a-11e5-bfc3-0e93edfed695

1630,NPCI adds 'UPI Number' to the UPI Framework,"**The Why?**

Users had unique email ID like **UPI IDs (example@upi)** which could be used across apps to allow interoperability b/w different app users in sending & receiving. This functionality could easily be used in smartphones but not elsewhere like feature phones using UPI through USSD based [\*99#](https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/99/product-overview).

**The What?**

**UPI Number** is not the mobile number (although it also can be). Previously, to send money to other app users, only the UPI ID (example@upi) or QR could be used. Entering a PhonePe User's mobile number in Google Pay did not let the user be found because money could be sent only to the same app user.

UPI Number (Random 8-9 digits) are now an alternative to the UPI ID for ease of use in feature phones using \*99#. Now, you can create a new 8-9 digit number OR use your mobile number **&** link it with your UPI ID. Now this freshly created **UPI number** can be used as an alternative method to the UPI ID making it easy for everyone, different app users & feature-phone users.

&#x200B;

* If you create a new 8-9 digit UPI num.: This UPI number can be shared with anyone & be used in any app to receive money just like using the UPI ID, which allowed interoperability.
* If you use your mobile num as the UPI num.: This mobile number can be shared with anyone & be used in any app to receive money. Previously someone could only send you money using mobile number if you used the same app, but now since it's your UPI number, it can be used in any app to receive payments.

&#x200B;

Now you only need to use one app, have one UPI ID & share one UPI Number to send & ask for one UPI number to receive money from anyone. ^(Especially those who use mobile numbers to send & receive)

1631,IMO the Indian education system is actually quite effective and ingenious.,"Yes, you heard it right. Contrary to popular belief, imo the Indian education system(conventional education system in general) is quite effective in accomplishing its purpose: Creating an army of human machines who know not to think for themselves, but to do what they are told without questioning. 




Whoever came up with this education system was obviously quite ingenious and this education system was designed to train his labourers to do his job more effectively and lose the ability to question his decisions, thereby reducing conflict and increased efficiency in accomplishing his tasks. I believe there's a high chance that the guy who came up with this education system, didn't want his children to use it 




Now how this system manages to curb people's thinking power? Because people are rewarded on the basis of rote learning. Basically, blindly accepting whatever information is being provided to them, eating it all up as it is, and vomiting out the same in exams. The person who memorize more, accept everything provided to them as it is, perform better in exams evaluating your rote learning abilities and are rewarded with better results. And thus people are conditioned to believe every information being provided to them as truth.



However, this education system also subtly provides hints and tasks(home work for ex) that tell people to think for themselves:become smarter. This is so subtle that only the smart people figure it out and use it, leaving the rest as machines.



Now finally, why is it useful to have only a few smart people controlling lots of machines? Because if everyone starts to think for themselves, everyone becomes smart, there would just be too much opinion input. Everybody would have good suggestions/arguments, and it would become extremely difficult to arrive at a consensus which will make it nearly impossible to get any work done.

But if only few people making decisions,  arriving at consensus is done easily. And the work can be made to do by the human machines. Thus making the process efficient.

This is a ridiculous conspiracy theory you say? Well why else do we have subjects like physics, chemistry, cs etc.? To get some physics work done effectively. To get some chemistry work done efficiently. Training skilled labors, no matter how you see it.


There would be three kinds of people reading this post.

1. Those who got offended by it, downvoted, left a nasty comment, ridiculing comment etc. They are the labourers who had been fed some information which makes my post go against their mental programming.

2. Those who will read and fully agree with me, thinking this post was a sarcastic dig at Indian education system. And since they have been programmed to hate the education system, they blindly agreed with everything I said. Another type of labourers.

3. The people who read my post, got intrigued by what I was saying, take time and started analyzing and thinking for themselves if what I'm saying actually makes sense or not, not believing me blindly and forming their own opinions based on their own understanding and knowledge. These people are the smart ones and the leaders",7,Science/Technology,"Flair_id    40e5c9b0-316a-11e5-bfc3-0e93edfed695

1632,Are Airpods worth it?,"So my 2 year old airpods just stopped working. The right side bud is getting heated up in the case and obviously not working. I took to the authorized Apple service center and he casually says, Sir its around 2 years old, you should just buy a new pair.

I asked is there no option to replace the right bud? The dude says, it might be an issue with the bud or the case so if you get the right bud also you might face an issue so just buy a new pair. Something feels off about the casual way these guys ask a customer to buy new one instead of even giving a solution.

I did some research online and it seems average life of the Airpods is around 2-3 years.  


Oh and I also forgot to mention that the 1st pair of airpods I got completely went dead in a week so after fighting a lot with Apple guys, they replaced it. They were pushing for service.

1658,"Buying a new phone, keep this in mind.....","From last couple of months I have seen r/India being flooded with posts asking about what phone to buy, which phone is best for privacy, which iPhone is the best - iPhone 13pro or 13pro Max (dude wtf). I am going to spill what I know  or what I consider is important while buying a phone. You guys have something, please do tell. It would be highly appreciated.

&#x200B;

**Some Basics to keep in mind:**

1. Don't waste time looking for non-Chinese brands as Indian market is flooded with Chinese brands. Your only option for non Chinese brand would be Samsung, Apple and Asus. Thing with Chinese brands is that they will provide you with better specification in budget and non Chinese would become out of budget pretty quickly.
2. Ads in the UI - pretty nasty situation but if you are buying a sub 20k phone then expect it in most phones. Samsung also had them but last I checked they are removing the ads. Motorola and Nokia (HMD) doesn't have ads baked into the UI for their budget phones.
3. Specifications - until and unless you are sucker for top of the line specification, don't buy the flagships. If your livelihood doesn't depend on it there's not so much of worth buying a flagship phone. (These are generalized specification.... don't think of them as some gospel truth)
   1. Processor - From last 1-2 years Snapdragon processors have reached their peaks in performance department. There have been only marginal improvements in performance. Heck! most 800 series processors are amped up versions of their old counterparts. 700 series (also considered Mid range processor) and 800 series processor are getting quite close to each other. ***important thing to remember is if you want to keep using your phone for long time avoid buying a phone with Mediatek processors.***
   2. Screen- 90/120Hz refresh rate, Amoled, min of 1080p resolution (iPhone XR is 720p) --- that's more than enough. Anything on top of that is just overkill because most of us folks don't require them and most of us don't even notice it.
   3. Camera - its one thing that I care very less about. I just want my phone to click the pic when required. Only cameras you will require would be 20/40MP mains, decent ultrawide (and if need be a telephoto lens). Most phones do decent enough job of capturing a pic that you can share on Instagram/Twitter/Whatsapp/Facebook or whatever you use. If you don't believe me check MKBHD's Blind Camera test videos. You will get the idea. ***If your livelihood depends on camera then you can spend on better camera phone.***
   4. Budget - if you have more than 30/40/50/100k to burn on a smartphone why you even bothered about what phone to buy. What your budget states, buy it. 5. Android vs iOS - that's your own preference. But yeah! don't buy 4-5 year old iPhones just to brag about it.

Edit : Mediatek processors apart from heating issues and battery optimization doesn't have any problem as such. When I say you should avoid getting a non Mediatek device that's because non Mediatek devices are easier to build Custom ROM for. And if you intend to use your phone after the OEM ends the support without the security issues Custom ROM is the way to go.

Edit: I intend to use my phone for a long time. I don't have that kind of luxury to buy some expensive device or change my device frequently. If I'm buying a device, I'm going to milk it to the last drop. That's why I heavily incline towards after market support of device. So my advice will always be to go the Custom ROM route.

**If you care about your privacy -** remember privacy matters mostly on how you use your device and not solely on what device you are using.

* If you don't want to tinker with your phones i.e. Custom ROMs, Mods etc
   * Apple iPhone - undeniably iPhones are far better phones among the competition but then they charge you a handsome amount for that. I don't need to explain what's good and what's not about iPhones.
      * Coming onto the privacy part - ***First and foremost if you believe that Apple care about your privacy and they are the good guys, please come out of that bubble as quickly as you can because they aren't as good as you might think. Not going to lie, Settings that are baked into the iOS and Apple's closed source approach does provide better privacy centric device compared to competition but still in the end it boils down to how you going to use your device.***
   * Google Pixel and Samsung devices - Out of the box these devices are not privacy centric; you would need to tinker with the phone settings and would have to use your device in a bit diligent manner.
* If you are comfortable with Custom ROMs and Mods....
   * This is what I advice the most to anyone who wants to buy a new phone because this is what I consider the best approach, at-least for me.

1. Look for the device which a developer community support.
2. Device which has easy to unlock bootloader
3. If developer community support is not available then the device whose custom libraries are available. It helps in building your own custom ROMs. (***avoid this if you don't understand***)

* Coming to specifics -

1. Always go for Xiaomi devices and in that too the mainline devices. Example - Note ""XYZ"",  ""XYZ"" Pro,  ""XYZ"" Pro Max (in general Pro and Pro Max are quite similar devices). Their Mi phones are the best option out there.
2. Xiaomi devices have one of the largest developer community out there. From old days of Redmi Note 3 to recent Mi11X....you will find developers working on these phones day in day out. I'm running Android 11 on my 5 year old Redmi Note 4 whose official OEM support ended within 1 year of launch of device.
3. Another good choice would be Google Pixels. Developers are working to make the old pixels usable after their official support ended. You can find people still working on old 2012 nexus devices.
4. None of the BBK electronic devices are developer friendly apart from One Plus. Old OnePlus devices were quite developer friendly and if you are rocking a OP device (till 8) then you are good to go. Newer ones make it really hard to develop for.

>important thing to remember is if you want to keep using your phone for long time avoid buying a phone with Mediatek processors

Snapdragon devices are better known to developers and they have much better support. Development for Mediatek devices is pretty much non existent.

* If you are way too into privacy then, buy a Mi11x or Redmi note 10 pro. Unlock the bootloader and install Lineage OS. If you are happy without Google services then use Free and Open Source Apps (FOSS Apps).
* If you still need to use the google services then use Micro G.
* Install some necessary mods via Magisk manager.
* About the banking apps - most banking apps do work. If not then people have ways to make them work. Don't worry about it. (only once it happened with me that my GPay didn't work but found the solution)
* Another good thing, you can use the g-Cam (google pixel camera app). *though you can use it without the Custom ROM*
* If you have Xiaomi Mi A2 or Pixel device then you can install Calyx OS which is heavily privacy centric OS. (You can check out their website)

&#8203;

    Just keep in mind that 100 % privacy can't be guaranteed. Every manufacturer has baked in telemetry in their smartphone. Your device will send some or other form of data to the OEM. Above methods can guarantee you much secure device if you are intelligent in usage. 

**If you don't care about your privacy: - expect Shit UI, Ads, Bloatware, no security Updates after a year or two**

* Offerings from all the subsidiaries of BBK electronics - Vivo, Oppo, Realme, OnePlus, IQOO in sub 30k segment are really good. Most of these devices come with decently powerful specification and some with flagship grade specification. Just avoid buying Vivo, Oppo and IQOO in sub 20k. Realme in my opinion is killing it in sub 20k segment for last 2/3 years. just a note - ***""Oppo, Realme and OnePlus all share same UI. So you decide""***
* Samsung - sub 20k just avoid it. Above it, buy according to your budget. **Even in 20-30k, my personal advice would be to avoid Samsung and go for your favourite Chinese brand :)**
* Xiaomi - it used to be king in sub 20k but now......meh!... Still if you are on tight budget sub 10k-15k go for decently spec-ed Xiaomi device. As of now they have really, like seriously, good devices in 25k - 35k range (all the forks of Mi11). But if you going to spend that much then you can go for something else also - ""OnePlus""
* Motorola - last couple of years they have released outright shit phones to decent to pretty competitive devices. One good thing about them - stock Android UI with really quality of life mods. If I remember correctly, they are promising 2-3 years of Updates also. This should be one of those devices one should seriously consider.
* Asus - this is one brand I seriously thought would hit the Indian market. But only device they have as of now is Asus ROG phone which is in my opinion a great device overall.
* Nokia - I don't even know what they are doing. So you people can tell.
* Google - compelling devices, with if not best then one of the best cameras and fastest android updates.....but last two phones weren't released in India (and in other markets too). So...I'm bit skeptical about their future.

*I know that, this isn't as specific as most people would have wanted but these are some of the common stuff that you should know if you are buying a new phone. I think it would be really appreciable if you people would give your thoughts and your experiences so that it becomes easier for other people to buy new phone.*

# tl;dr

On December 15th, 2021, CERT-IN reached out to the Election Commission of India (ECI) IT team, which patched a vulnerability in the ECI’s National Voters Service Portal website that allowed access to unredacted, registered phone numbers of voters. Though this was fixed, awareness about the issue and its consequences are limited. Keeping that in mind, IFF, along with Sai Krishna Kothapalli, the independent researcher who came across this technical snag, attempt to provide you with a background of the issue, explain the loopholes that caused this vulnerability and elaborate on the consequences of privacy breach of citizens.

# Background

On December 16th, 2021, news media reports indicated a vulnerability in the National Voters Service Portal ([NVSP](https://www.nvsp.in/)) that allowed access to registered voters’ phone numbers. This critical vulnerability was discovered by Sai Krishna Kothapalli, founder/ CEO of Hackrew, a Hyderabad based cybersecurity firm. He discovered this vulnerability while downloading his e-EPIC (Electoral Photo Identity Card) from the NVSP.

On October 22, 2021, when Mr. Kothapalli first discovered this, he sent a vulnerability submission to [CERT-IN](https://www.cert-in.org.in/) (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team), which is the national nodal agency for responding to computer security incidents as and when they occur. Despite a 72-working hour deadline for acknowledging the vulnerability as stated in the CERT-IN website, they responded to Mr. Kothapalli after 46 days, on 7th December, 2021, informing that they were in touch with concerned authorities to take required action. They reached out to him again on 15th December, confirming that the vulnerability had been fixed, probably sometime in the preceding week.

“The plugging of the loophole has not only prevented a major data leak — exposing the personal mobile phone numbers of several crores of voters across the country — but averted a possible scam during the process of elections. By accessing a mobile number, and using another [vulnerability](https://kmskrishna.me/how-i-could-send-any-text-message-from-indian-government-ids-b61c5b8726c9) I found, we can send an SMS that will appear as if it came from credible Government IDs. For instance, we can send a message to a voter giving some misleading information that could deprive him/her of casting the vote. So one can imagine this on a larger scale, impacting crores of votes across India,” said Mr. Kothapalli.

# Loopholes Explained

Though information published on electoral rolls, which is already publicly available, can’t lead to any harm by itself, access to registered phone numbers linked with voter databases could have disastrous consequences. Mr. Kothapalli, in his [blog](https://kmskrishna.me/leaking-personal-phone-numbers-of-all-registered-indian-voters-fc47375af43d), has explained extensively how anyone with a little bit of technical know-how can access anyone’s personal phone numbers associated with voter IDs.

What’s interesting to note is that to do so, the only information required is the EPIC number and State name.  Upon entering this information, one is able to view information such as Name, Father’s Name, State, Constituency, Mobile No, and Email ID. As shown in the image above, the mobile number and email ID information is redacted/ censored. The vulnerability gets exposed in the next step, when the system sends an OTP to the registered mobile number. The response sent to the browser (as shown in the images below) includes the voter’s unredacted phone number.

**Source:** [**How I Could Leak Personal Phone Numbers of All Registered Indian Voters’: Sai Krishna Kothapalli**](https://kmskrishna.me/leaking-personal-phone-numbers-of-all-registered-indian-voters-fc47375af43d)

EPIC numbers are publicly available on electoral rolls published by the Election Commission of India (ECI) during elections. Thus, one would simply need to write a simple script to get access to the unredacted personal phone number of every voter in a particular constituency. Though voters could be targeted by other means, both specifically and randomly, the process is very cumbersome and time taking.

Combining this leaked information with the earlier mentioned loophole, which allows sending bulk text messages using credible government IDs such as “HPGOVT” or “ECISMS”, will inevitably lead to manipulation of elections, threatening the integrity of the electoral process. The scope of such breach is terrifying, especially considering that these messages are sent using credible sender IDs reserved by government and private organisations. “This is so far the most dangerous and highly effective way you can abuse this loophole. Huge sections of the country can be targeted in election-related scams this way, potentially rendering crores of individual voices meaningless”, added Mr. Kothapalli.

[IFF](https://internetfreedom.in/dont-penalise-cybersecurity-researchers/#) had previously [written](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mmiJWnxJL3wHJ_fzlcfGCgreSApTyUNu/view) to the CERT-IN pointing out a problematic [provision](https://www.cert-in.org.in/RVDCP.jsp) in their new Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure and Coordination Policy that penalises cybersecurity researchers for vulnerability disclosures, inhibiting voluntary disclosures by researchers. We had recommended that this clause of the Policy be amended, and that an explicit provision for protection of genuine security disclosures from vexatious legal claims and proceedings be specified.

CERT-In [responded](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cejTBwl2W4ZePIkBnQcBYISbucz6FIED/view) to our representation explaining that the Policy is an executive decision and thus must follow the existing provisions of the law. In light of this, we [wrote](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gHq1fem8aG1vCGr4N2u1XwEmEqWi1IzM/view) to MeitY, asking them to amend the [Information Technology Act](https://eprocure.gov.in/cppp/rulesandprocs/kbadqkdlcswfjdelrquehwuxcfmijmuixngudufgbuubgubfugbububjxcgfvsbdihbgfGhdfgFHytyhRtMjk4NzY=), 2000 to provide a safe harbour for genuine security researchers. The [fact](https://internetfreedom.in/over-to-you-meity/) that several data breaches are not discovered and/or disclosed by the data fiduciaries but rather by independent digital security researchers, it is imperative that robust vulnerability reporting mechanisms protect vulnerability researchers from harm.

# Consequences

The above screenshots provided by Mr. Kothapalli proves that such a vulnerability exists and it could be misused by political organisations with ulterior motives, affecting lakhs and crores of voters. The fact that such misinformation could be spread using credible government IDs and that sensitive personal information was being leaked on official government websites is even more cause for concern. Another such concern was flagged by [media outlets](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/data-breaches-expose-emails-passwords-of-several-government-officials-to-hackers/article34798982.ece), around June last year, when hundreds of emails and passwords of Union government officials were leaked due data breaches by Air India, Domino’s and Big Basket. These leaked emails on government domains such as u/nic.in and u/gov.in were used by hackers to send malicious emails, targeted towards government employees.

In March 2021, [news outlets](https://article-14.com/post/govt-has-cleared-linking-of-aadhaar-voter-data-past-experience-reveals-how-it-can-be-manipulated-61c937a621c09) reported that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launched a data driven campaign in Puducherry, sending bulk text messages to prospective supporters, a month before elections. A. Anand, a political activist from the union territory, filed a PIL in the Madras High Court, alleging that only mobile numbers linked to Aadhaar received such text messages, indicating BJP’s access to personal information of voters. Though the BJP denied these allegations, the Madras High Court upheld the allegation as ‘credible’.

In a similar case two years ago, a raid conducted by the special investigation team of the Telangana Police revealed that IT Grids (India) Pvt Ltd, a Hyderabad-based private company, built a mobile application for the then incumbent Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh, using their illegal access to information about “stolen” voter details and Aadhaar data of around 78 million residents of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. This leak was further [confirmed](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/it-grids-row-uidai-accuses-company-hired-tdp-stealing-7-crore-aadhaar-numbers-100007) by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). Moreover, during elections in the two states around that time, 5.5 million voters, who had linked their Aadhaar with voter ids, were deleted from the electoral roll.

The recent [Election Laws (Amendment) Bill 2021](http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/162_2021_LS_Eng.pdf), controversially passed in December, which attempts to link Aadhaar with the electoral roll data, broadens the possibility of election manipulation through voter profiling and targeting, predicting voting trends and choices, deleting inconvenient voters from the electoral roll and sending bulk messages to prospective voters. The rise of cybersecurity threats around government websites stress the need for data security and cyber safety training.

# An unsatisfactory response from NIC

In view of the data breaches and vulnerabilities on government websites leaking personally identifiable information of citizens, putting them at risk, we filed a [request for information](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TLS5KOzeeKs5qgpSiTuIuOsiJVXRncaZ/view) with the National Informatics Center (NIC), Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India. In our request, we asked for details and information on the government websites developed and currently managed by NIC. We also asked the PIO to share information on the security audits carried out in the previous six months, in accordance with NIC’ own website security guidelines.

It is shocking to note that the [response](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v7DfXQ62u82_hy07QzHZILsh7oT1sWRj/view) notes that there is no “compilation available on record with NIC” and that “the maintenance and content of the websites are the responsibility of the individual departments or states or districts or projects.”

The response is problematic for several reasons:

1. NIC has stated that the security of government websites is tasked with the departments or ministries, even though security is a listed service. This is worrisome as here the capacity for cyber security may not exist independently.
2. Moreover, it is in clear dereliction of the Clause 1 of the [website security guidelines](https://nic-cert.nic.in/pdf/Website%20Security%20Guidelines.pdf) which covers all  NIC employees, temporary/contractual staffs, vendors, third party personnel, central and state government employees and other stakeholders who are involved in website/ application – development, administration, management; and mandates them to “ensure that the website is security audited and an audit clearance certificate is issued by a CERT-IN empaneled vendor before hosting in production environment”.
3. Additionally, several union ministries’ websites clearly display ‘managed by NIC’ banners in the footnotes, therefore, to claim that the maintenance of websites is the responsibility of individual departments is misleading.

After receiving this incomplete and false response, we’ve filed a [first appeal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IN5SzK0FgNOF6kRKVQ7tM-Iw17h8QO9t/view) with the appellate authority again reiterating our request for a list of websites managed by NIC. In the coming days, we also plan to send a representation to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology with our recommendations on strengthening India’s cyberspace and closing vulnerability loopholes.

I only care about SMS (not voice) as I need to access banking/bill pay during my overseas trip.

1683,Is there any way I can buy a cheap yet efficient laptop in india? (second hand would work as well) + how do I convince my parents?,"Okay, hey! So i am 18f, a college student now. I need a little help :) 

I am not a techno head or whatever, so i have no idea how to go with this. I come from a middle class family, so i am not Richie rich exactly. 

Now, as i started college, there have been a lot of meetings/auditions for societies and clubs that take place in the evening. I have one great laptop but unfortunately have to share it with my brother (16m). We both like playing games and all that and that's why he INSISTS that i should give him the laptop in the evenings. 

I don't mind actually, but since college started, i have not been able to game (or edit/learn motion graphics). I don't think this info is necessary but anyways, i absolutely require the laptop, the whole day. Meetings on phones aren't exactly professional plus i just cannot concentrate. 

More than that, the editing softwares i use or am learning to use are heavy and my brother says and i quote, ""Windows C wali drive puri bhar jati hai and laptop slow hojayega."" which loosely translates to the fact that due to me using my editing softwares, the laptop can become slow and will affect his gaming experience. 

I really am thinking about buying a new for myself but as I mentioned, i do not come from a rich background. There's more to why i require a laptop but right now I'm a little high on adrenaline rush. NEVERMIND. 

I will buy a second hand one, i don't mind. I just want one where i can do all the things I can do with a new laptop. I want specs like i5 (i hope it's called that? I am really sorry i am dumbo dumb at this stuff). I also want one with the fans (???) so that the laptop doesn't heat up and a one which can render high quality videos plus great graphics. 

Now let's talk money, i have 5k with me. How the heck do I convince my parents to pitch in? I am not sure if they will agree. Also, can someone take a third person perspective and tell me if my demand is unreasonable or reasonable? I don't wanna be that girl who throws a tantrum because of an electronic. 

ANYWAYS, i would prefer if you could prefer a verified walk in store in New Delhi. Online market would also work. Also, has anyone had a similar experience? Could you assist me, please? I feel really bad about wanting a new one :(

THANK YOU FOR READING ANYWAYS!!! HOPE EVERYONE'S OKAY xx

Edit: Your comments made me so happy lmao especially the one asking me to go cook in the kitchen. I talked to my parents and well they're going to give me a loan and i will pay them back or try to, lmao. 

Anyways, thanks to all the blessed people who have helped me out with specifications in the comments as well as dms :) really looking forward to buying one on my own!!! thanks <33",6,Science/Technology,"Flair_id    40e5c9b0-316a-11e5-bfc3-0e93edfed695

Never really realised how bad telemarketing was in India until I was outside India last year. As soon as I came back I started receiving 5-8 calls every day minimum even though I had DND. (I still do. I think there’s no proper fix for this) 

But Doosra gives you a secondary number which you can pretty much use everywhere. Think of it as a second sim. By default every call is blocked( you can set up filters to let some calls through) and the caller can leave a voicemail. 

The utility is pretty good. But their ios app is still a bit shitty and there’s no trial. You need to pay 1k upfront which made me hesitant to try. During Diwali they sold for 500. Now that I’ve tried it I’d definitely renew it for 1k next year.",28,Science/Technology,"Flair_id    40e5c9b0-316a-11e5-bfc3-0e93edfed695

My sole requirement is noise cancellation,  as I might be moving to hostel soon and need something to be able to study around noisy roommates. So do they really work as advertised, like complete silence, won't be able to hear even if someone was shouting in my ear? Cause that would be ideal.

My budget is 10k but would prefer as cheap as possible. As someone who has been using free earphones my entire life and been content with them, the only justification for spending that much would be if there is complete noise cancellation, like absolute blank. So please give recommendations if such a beast exists as I am a complete noob and don't trust amazon reviews for splurging this much on something like headphones.",1,Science/Technology,"Flair_id    40e5c9b0-316a-11e5-bfc3-0e93edfed695

AYUSH which stands for Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy, is a ministry opened to support quackery and fool people in the name of medicine. Babas and criminals lobby government to sell their quack products. All of these systems are either pseudo-science or proto-science. In the 21st century it is ""Evidence based medicine"" which works, which homeopaths have named as ""Allopathy"".

Having said that, I am in no way against traditional medicine, chinese traditional medicine has also won a Nobel Prize in 2015, but only after it was experimentally verified and hence it falls under the category of ""Evidence based medicine"" rather than traditional medicine.

I want the following out of the laptop:

Budget: I am willing to spend (70000₹) on it but if it’s good enough can be expanded.


-A good display with decent brightness and good color accuracy/Vibrant and anti glare ( for watching movies and long study sessions) a 15.6’’ screen will do good

- A powerful ryzen 5 or i5 CPU will be enough

-The cooling Mechanism should be good don’t like it when it gets too hot on the keyboard

-A lasting battery of 6 or more hours

-Backlit keyboard

-It should be somewhat portable I won’t carry it alot but don’t want it too bulky and heavy

-And most importantly I want it to last long at least until i finish college which might take 3yrs build quality should be decent enough

I brought a laptop from Canada and need some help with it. As you know both the plugs and Voltage in power supply in both the countries are different.

1. Will it be enough to purchase just a Canada to India converter plug?
2. The Canada charger plug did fit into one of the socket in our home, so i started charging the laptop for the first time. But the charging of the battery is taking a lot time. Is it because of the voltage different in the power supply in Canada and India or is it because i am charging it for the first time? If it's because of voltage difference, is there a device to accommodate for the voltage difference?

If a high-scoring candidate does not use their talents to perform good actions, it would be difficult to call them meritorious merely because they scored high marks,” Justice Chandrachud reasoned.


""If open examinations present equality of opportunity to candidates to compete, reservations ensure that the opportunities are distributed in such a way that backward classes are equally able to benefit from such opportunities which typically evade them because of structural barriers. This is the only manner in which merit can be a democratising force that equalises inherited disadvantages and privileges. Otherwise claims of individual merit are nothing but tools of obscuring inheritances that underlie achievements,” a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and A.S. Bopanna observed in a 106-page judgment.

Now moving to the main reason for this post. They wrote my name, address, phone number, took my DL. Got the driving licence and the rough sheet (on which they wrote my details) back after I bribed them. They were asking me to go to police station, file NC with them, go to court and collect back the fee paid in police station. I begged them not to do so, don't want anything on record. Now my reason for concern is, the other policeman had a register of sort, in which he scribbled something. Definitely couldn't get as much details as in the rough paper. Should I be concerned?   
  
What is NC? He said, he doesn't want anything to go on record aswell, and filing NC won't have any effect.  I doubted that and talked my way out of it. But is that true?

The situation is that my dad is in a good position in central government job and will be retiring this year. During the retirement process they check your conduct professional and personal. And my dad is be blamed from some repetition of allowing same vendor multiple times, which government doesn't allow. My dad says he didn't do it intentionally but did because his boss asked him to (now his boss has changed), now I don't want to go into wether he did it or not. Let's say he did it intentionally. Is there a way how he can get out of it ?

1758,Is it legal to record video of a Police officer in Delhi?,"I had a harrowing experience yesterday, when my friend and I was questioned while walking in the park by a police officer. He questioned us, if we were smoking in the park and started frisking us violently, they did find a cigarette in my friends bag but many other people
smoke in that public place. We started recording but he snached my phone and took us to the station. The officer also looked through my personal details on my phone, like  images, messages and the phone recordings that I had made previously and threatened that he would take me inside the jail and show me what happenes when one records a police office. So, my question is it illegal to record a police officer?  I felt it was a harrassment and I had to pay 2000 challan. 

Also, I am from Northeast, so I felt I was targeted by the officer. Kindly send in the suggestion what I can do legally next time if this ever happens. I have never felt so excluded in my own country.",619,Law & Courts,"Flair_id    687b3904-6082-11eb-af80-0e41d1ca0be9

Who's fault we can count?

**Q.5.** Minor and major age rules(with INDIAN and non-INDIAN, both the perspective) apply to sexting too?

1766,Neighbour threatens to cut water line. What can I do?,"For context, I live on rent in a 3 storied apartment building (in Delhi) where I reside on the second floor. The other two floors are owned by two families. The owner of my flat, i.e. my landlord lives a few buildings away.

A few days back, my neighbour who resides on the first floor, complained that her ceiling was getting damp, presumably because of water seeping from the second floor's pipes. I conveyed the same to my landlord, who asked me to tell my neighbour to get it fixed and he'll pay all plumbers fees and charges. 

When I informed my neighbour the same, she said that she won't do that and my landlord needs to fix it by himself asap. I then asked her to have a conversation with my landlord on the phone, so that they can reach to some mutual understanding. She refused and said that she'll keep pestering me only until my landlord fixes it. That evening I called my landlord and conveyed the message. He said he'd come to our apartment and deal with it. However, he didn't. The next few days were quiet. 

Today my neighbour came up to my floor again, and again started shouting on me that why isn't it fixed and threatened that she'll cut our water line. I calmly replied that I'll talk to my landlord again.

I called my landlord, informed him all this, asked him to come meet this neighbour and sort it out, and he replied he'll try to come or at the very least, he'll definitely send a plumber today to fix it.

I'm not sure whether he'll look into it but I definitely don't want to loose out on my water connection. So please advice if I can do anything in this case, as I'm stuck between two parties who aren't willing to resolve the issue within themselves. And can someone actually cut someone else's water line without legal repercussions?

Btw, the water connection line is accessible only in the water pump's compartment which is locked and only the 3 flat owners have keys to it.",11,Law & Courts,"Flair_id    687b3904-6082-11eb-af80-0e41d1ca0be9

Section 295A makes deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs a crime.

1783,Company not paying salary and sending termination letter with no legal justification," 

Short summary of my problem - I am not being allowed by my company to work since June 2020 and I have not been paid my salary by the company since the same time ( last 18 months) and no written explanation has been provided by the company for the same even after repeated emails from my side.

Detailed scenario : I am an MBA from a tier 1 B school and was part of the Growth Strategy team of an IT services major based out of Noida (Hint : The CEO earns the highest among all IT service companies). Company is headquartered in Pune. I had joined the company from B school in 2018.

The pandemic lockdown started in March 2020, That very week, I was called into a meeting involving my manager and an HR person. In the meeting, it was stated that the company was not happy with my performance and wanted me to resign at that very moment, although my manager was unable to share details about any specific situation where I failed to perform or carry out my duties.

The company also refused to offer any Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) and refused to offer any explanation for that.

I refused to resign, however the HR person took away my laptop and ID card and blocked my email access.

After that incident, the HR team would call me up or email me asking me to resign, which I refused.

Then they tried to convince me to come to the office for some sort of discussion in the middle of the pandemic. They refused to have the so-called discussion over phone and did not share any explanation for the same.

Since they asked me to visit their office in the middle of the pandemic, I requested them to share a written statement, that if I get infected with Covid while traveling to the office, the company would take all responsibility for my medical care. They refused to share that as well.

After a few days, they changed their stance, and started emailing me asking me to REPORT TO WORK. Every time I responded that I was always available and eager to work. and stated that they only had to restore my email and laptop. I never received any response related to that.

Also, I emailed them a number of times enquiring about why my salary has been stopped since June 2020. I never received any response or explanation regarding the same.

This has been going on since June 2020.

I have been transparent about my request from the very beginning, but have not received any concrete response either from management or the HR.

Since I had a lot of patience and respect for the company, I did not do any of that because I hoped that the company would rectify their mistake and treat me fairly, but nothing has happened till now.

Earlier I had personally tried reaching out to my manager, my manager’s manager, as well as the Chief People Officer for amicable resolution, but nothing fruitful came out of it.

In the past several months, neither the HR team nor my manager even cared to call and enquire if I was even alive or dead.

All they cared about was my resignation.

Update : Also it seems that the HR team has sent me a termination letter on my email on 7th Jan 2022. They did not offer any justified reason for the same. Refused to pay me my dues since June 2020, also did not offer any compensation for trying to terminate me.

Before anyone asks about why I did not apply for other jobs : I did apply for multiple jobs, but somehow nothing has worked out so far. Either the company ghosts after taking interviews, or they say that the position is on hold.

Some times bad times just go on and on. I am preparing and constantly looking for opportunities mainly in Strategy, Product Management, Program Management etc and hope to find something relevant soon enough.

I also had to deal with issues related to health and financial matter both personally and also of other family members, so that was also a set back and took a lot of time.

Yesterday I already emailed the CEO and the Chairman asking for amicable resolution. Not sure if that will help.

The inputs i request from you guys.

1. Input from Folks who actually have been unfairly treated by employers, they steps they took against the companies, what was the step by step process, timelines, expenses, and outcome. I basically want to hear from the horse's mouth.
2. Where can i get a list of solid lawyers, who specialize in labour law. Pls don't suggest online portals. I want someone with referance. A badly drafted legal notice can screw things up for me.
3. Anything else i might need to keep in mind before moving against the employer.

I had posted this on r/LegalAdviceIndia . But most responses were like i need to take legal steps, involve labour commission etc. ?Looking for a little more specific advice",138,Law & Courts,"Flair_id    687b3904-6082-11eb-af80-0e41d1ca0be9

The Hadith used to justify hijab as an essential practice is - 

 Hadith no. 4092 kitab al libas (book of clothing Sunan Abu Dawud): ""O Asma! It is not correct for a woman to show her parts other than her hands and face to strangers after she begins to have menstruation ""

Others were related to punishment for not wearing said clothing.  


This was one of three used ( as per the Kerala HC proceedings) . I find it problematic.

1811,Karnataka #Hijab Case: First Hearing,"The petitioner for the girls argued:

1. The prayer is to allow the student to enter college wearing #Hijab. Another petitioner - only very limited time is left for the academic year. Let them be permitted for two months at least.

2. Advocate General: This involves a question whether there is a right to wear hijab in educational institution under Article 25 ... substantial questions of law are there.

3. The bench says it will start hearing the matter on merits as the State is not agreeable to suggestion of the petitioners to allow the wearing of #Hijab for the last two months of the current academic year.

4. They have issued a Government Order (GO) ... The conclusion of the GO is that there is no fundamental right to wear head scarf.

5. Justice Dixit notes the first point of law - We are not talking of burqa or entire veil. It is head scarf. The first submission is that the wearing of the hijab is an essential religious practice of Islam.

6. The second proposition is that the right to wear a dress is a facet of the fundamental right to speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a). The threshold of ""public order"" is extremely high to restrict this right. 

7. Justice Dixit notes the proposition of Kamat: The grounds on which the impugned order has been structured are not relatable to those permitted under Article 19 (2). 

8. Justice Dixit notes the next proposition: Right to wear falls within the privacy right recognised by Puttaswwmy jurisprudence, and therefore the impugned order not taking cognisance of this is not right.

9. The next proposition advanced ... is that the State has no competence to issue the GO on dress code as per the Karnataka Education Rules. The GO is beyond the jurisdiction of the state.

**""Hijab is an essential religious practice of Islam""**

**Justice Dixit**: *Where holy scriptures are cited, the court should verify which is the authentic scripture and then proceed. This is stated in Mulla's book on Islamic law.*

- ... Two injunction in Holy Quran have been interpreted in several decisions from India to abroad. Refers to Kerala HC judgement AIR 2016 Kerala 115 (which allowed wearing of hijab for Medical Entrance Test). Kamat refers to this judgment of Kerala High Court which declared hijab as essential religious practice of Islam and allowed it in AIPMT ... Ultimately it boils down to if it is an essential practice. State is competent to interfere with any non-essential religious practice on reasonable grounds.

- Kamat quotes from the judgment : *""Religious practice cannot be tested on the secular thoughts or any other consideration outside the religious authority""*. **What constitutes an essential practise has to be determined on religions beliefs alone and not based on secular notions.**

- Kamat refers to another Madras High Court judgment which dealt with the issue of whether Muslim women clad in purdahs/burqas could be photographed for electoral roll. Kamat refers to this judgment of Madras High Court (M.Ajmal Khan vs The Election Commission Of India). Kamat quotes from the Madras HC judgment : ***""It is, thus, seen from the reported material that there is almost unanimity amongst Muslim scholars that purdah is not essential but covering of head by scarf is obligatory""***.

[The GO cited three cases to support ban on Hijab - petitioner points out that state cannot use it to support its GO as they involve different matter of laws].

- Kamat referring to the 2018 judgment of Kerala HC delivered by Justice Muhamed Mustaque which did not allow head scarves in a private school. Kamat highlights it was a Christian management school and hence the considerations are different. Article 30 gives minority institutions certain rights.

- **Justice Dixit**: So it was a case where two fundamental rights were competing?

- **Kamat**: Yes, and Article 30 was given primacy ...

- **Justice Dixit notes**: Kamat draws attention to another Kerala HC judgment and submits that in a case involving competing rights of two entities, one the students and the other the minority institution, it is a case of Article 29 vs 30, a doctrine of assimilation of rights ... the rights that availed to individuals under Article 25 were treated as subservient to rights under Articles 29 and 30. That being so the impugned order could not have drawn premise from this decision.

- ""Fatheema Hussain Sayed"" case of Bombay HC (2003), the third decision mentioned in the GO: Kamat says that this decision was in the context of an exclusively girl school. **The Court held that it was not mandatory for a Muslim girl to cover her head while studying in an all-girls school.**

- Kamat: Third decision cited in GO has nothing to do with Article 25. Teachers were prescribed a dress code. It was a question whether teachers can be required to wear a particular dress code. There was no Article 25 issue or #hijab involved there.

1815,SEX EDUCATION:——Indians and foreskin issues(Phimosis)),"Many of the kids and teens in india are not aware of their own body due to lack of sex education, if I would to take a random guess and say about 50% or more of the indian boys do not know that they need to pull back their foreskin and take shower or their are even many people who never ever pulled their foreskin back while masturbating or having sex, if you are the one and never pulled your foreskin then this post will really help you,i got to know about it at 19(age) and i was surprised how come I didn’t know about this also when i used to watch porn all i saw was circumcised penis so never got to know about pulling foreskin back, but when I actually discovered it i tried to do it the issue was i couldn’t pull it all the way back if i try to force the pain i would get was terrible and by doing some research i got to know i had PHIMOSIS(unable to pull foreskin all the way down), i was really scared and thought getting circumcised was the only solution but as i dive into this topic i got to know stretching methods can also help i did that and successfully retracted my foreskin. And now im happy but important thing is that as i was searching about this topic i got to know that majorly teens from india are suffering from this issue and i want to admit this. Sex ed is really important for anyone suffering from this it can be easily solved no need to worry have a good day👍.

Edit:- Many people were asking about the solution and many of them discovered that they have phimosis after this post so for all of them here is the information you need 

 
1) this link has everything you want to know about phimosis https://phimosisjourney.wordpress.com/guide/

Apart from personal donation (to the tune of a few lacs INR), it took almost a month of our life to help and support the people, our people in their time of need.

Now, the 3rd wave is here and I see people crowding in Baga beach or election rally. Moreover, Indian govt said there was no oxygen crunch and no one died because of oxygen in second wave. I have witnessed at least 3 deaths in close family, and 2 of them could have survived with timely oxygen.

1830,Looking to start an ADHD support group.,"It's been a lonely road with ADHD. Especially because here in India, there is no culture of support groups, hence little to no Avenue of finding people like ourselves. Hell, there's barely any recognition of mental health disorders even. I've been through therapy and it's nice to know there's someone who understands and is empathetic (my therapist) but also, I wish I knew more people like me. People who understood my ""language"", my struggles. People who knew why i am the way i am. Currently, nobody in my life truly knows or understands who i am. It's fair, considering i have myself have just begun understanding me. But I wish I knew more people like myself. Not sure if you all relate but I feel like an alien in this neurotypical world, and often find myself conforming to that way of life. On the outside, it looks like i have a ton of friends, but really, it's gut-wrenchingly lonely. May be if we knew more people like us, we'd feel confident and secure about embracing our true selves. May be it'll not seem like a disorder then.

Hit me up if you're keen!

tl;dr - An idea for a remote (for now) ADHD support group probably here or as a WhatsApp group where we can connect, relate, exchange notes, tips, tricks, and in general feel like we also belong to a tribe. So that it doesn't feel like a disorder.",61,Health/Environment,"Flair_id    67098c94-4720-11ec-9c52-7272f5f21dbd

1835,Need help with my mother's mental health issue,"In 2013, my mother had to be hospitalized due to mental health issues. Her condition went up and down for 2 years. Post 2015 she stabilised.
Since last week she has been showing the same signs as she was during the start in 2013. I am really scared. I don't want her to go through this again.
She just turns into a completely different person. She doesn't remember how her condition was back in 2013-2015. Back then she used to make claims that the relatives are conspiring against her and her family.  She makes theories in her head and says it like she believes it. These theories are far from being true (similar to 2013). Whatever she says mostly represents a sense of victimisation which I think has been because of her insecurities and low self esteem. She goes through a lot of mood swings (similar to 2013).
It is hard to make her come out of this trap that she has fallen back into. We try to convince her that ""whatever you are thinking is not true. it's all made up and you burdening yourself with thoughts"". She responds at that time after a 10-15 minute conversation ""tum log sahi bol rahe ho abse nahi karungi"" and maybe starts crying or a sudden shift of behaviour to show that she is alright. But after some time she goes back to thinking like that. The patterns I had seen at that time are repeating and I am worrying that her condition is going to go out of our control in a few days (she was hospitalized for 15 days in 2013).
I am really scared. What should I do?",55,Health/Environment,"Flair_id    67098c94-4720-11ec-9c52-7272f5f21dbd

What medicines/vitamins/nutrients/supplements/food items do you consume? I have tried yoga (pranayam) and it does definitely help. However sometimes the air does get pretty bad that this alone may not fully help.

I also visited a different city recently which had cleaner air in Delhi and I felt fine there. Even played sports and ran around with no issues - something that I can't even imagine doing in Delhi.

So when I was a kid I was diagnosed with a dust mite allergy and living in Delhi has exacerbated the issue because I have to breathe in this polluted air.

Delhi as we know is one of the most, if not the most, polluted city in the world. A doctor in the past has told me to move out of Delhi as the air really is bad.

However, on the other hand, you see people that are living normally despite all the pollution. It's common to see some people play around in parks without a mask and they don't seem to face any issues.

>Telangana's surgical deliveries stood at 74.9% against the 10-15% benchmark of the World Health Organisation (WHO), a report said on Wednesday , prompting the government to call for an audit.  
Tripura stands at 73.3% and West Bengal 70.9%, said the re port released at a workshop organised by UNICEF with the Telangana government and the Centre for Economic and Social Studies.  
The surgical option, performed to deliver a baby by way of an incision in the mother's abdomen, should be exercised cautiously , only when necessary.  
[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Telangana-tops-in-C-section-deliveries-in-pvt-hosps/articleshow/51821782.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Telangana-tops-in-C-section-deliveries-in-pvt-hosps/articleshow/51821782.cms)

If we take the numbers for urban private hospitals alone, the figure will be much higher.

Every woman I know, who had child birth in India had a Caesarean section, as they were scared and forced by the doc at the last minute. C-sections are much more profitable for pvt hospitals.

Almost every woman in Western countries has a normal delivery unless there is real need, and that's rare. The benchmark by WHO is 10-15%

What can a patient do at the last moment, when it is too late to change docs, and looking at the percentages, chances of finding an honest doc who will avoid unneccessary Caesarean is nil.",5,Health/Environment,"Flair_id    67098c94-4720-11ec-9c52-7272f5f21dbd

1867,Mental health and depression in India,"Hey guys, 

I am a college student and I went through a very rough phase a few weeks ago and I realised a few things. India is not very open to topics such as mental health and depression. It is considered taboo in India. I was very scared to share my genuine feeling with my own parents because I thought they would laugh it off and make things even worse. If I can't share it with my own parents leave other people. But soon when I shared all my feelings with my friend I realised that depression could be made easier in India only in two ways:

Share it with someone who can relate your feelings

Keep it to yourself and hope everything will work out

I felt so helpless that I still can't believe how trapped I felt at such a young age. I know that this is not my worse time. There is going to be more bad days as I grow up but I don't understand how is a innocent teenager suppose to fight all this burden all alone? Even though there is a rise in awareness about mental health and depression in college students but I still don't think it is enough. I am conducting a [survey](https://forms.gle/GsxKSBe68xsWDRBG8) on depression in India. and I came to a realization that not only teenagers but also overlooked categories such as people of age 50+ feel depression and this problem is rising thanks to COVID-19. I also realized that even though there is a rise in awareness about mental health there is a very less number of psychiatrists in my city. We need more clinical psychiatrists and that should be one of the top priorities if we want to improve the mental health of the youth of India. So I want to know what you all Redditors think about this topic of depression in india.

But this is quite different from several other agencies such as WHO, Red Cross, and a number of other national health bodies, whose regulations say that an asthmatic person can donate blood if they are not showing any symptoms/having any problems in a few days up to and including the day of donation.

Is there any plausible explanation for this difference?

1906,Some road safety tips for Indian roads,"In all the turmoil of the 3rd wave and the upcoming elections, we have forgotten that the Road Safety Week is currently ongoing. Although, COVID has been the top cause of death over the past couple of years, Road Accidents have been among the top 10 killers over the past decades. This year will be no different. That is why I would like to give some road safety tips to my fellow Indians here.

I am sharing these tips through my experience as a road crash investigator. In the past decade I have studied and investigated over a thousand crashes, involving thousands of deaths. Usually, a common outlook towards road safety is that it is the ""government's problem to solve"" and many expect government interventions. However, from my experience I can say that all road accidents and deaths could be prevented at the individual level. It is much easier to take care of ourselves than it is to wait for the government.

So, here are the most important tips from my experience. Unfortunately I cannot give a Tl;dr version as there are not shortcuts to road safety. However, I have tried to keep the tips as short as possible.

* The best way to prevent road accident injuries is by preventing the road accident itself. That is why I suggest that every driver in India, be it on a car or two-wheeler, should practice **Defensive Driving.** The basic essence of defensive driving is to drive assuming that every other road user is out there to harm you. This approach keeps a driver alert at all times and reduces the chances of unnecessary risks. Defensive Driving is a detailed topic and you will be able to find a lot of information online.
* As **Two-wheelers** are statistically the most dangerous vehicles on the road, I would like to give some useful tips to two-wheeler riders:

1. Starting with the most obvious one: Helmets. Every two-wheeler rider and pillion should wear a helmet every time you ride. The misconception in our country is that helmets should be worn to evade a fine. The main purpose of the helmet is to protect your head. You may evade a fine by evading the cops, but you cannot evade the laws of physics. The helmet is the most important part of your riding gear. Riding jackets, riding pants, etc. provide extra safety at higher speeds.
2. The second important tip is to be visible. Two-wheelers are the smallest of all vehicles on the road. I have studied countless accidents that were caused just because the two-wheelers were not visible to the other vehicles. Especially at night. A simple tip is to stick some good quality reflective strips on the sides of your bike and helmet.
3. Staying on the topic of visibility, every two-wheeler rider should take great care when they are going close to a truck or bus. Through no fault of their own, drivers of such heavy vehicles have massive blind spot areas around their vehicles. If you drive right next to a truck or plan to cut across one, there are good chances that the truck's driver will not see you and will hit you. An even worse scenario is when a two-wheeler rider loses control while overtaking close to a truck or bus and is run over by the heavy vehicle's tyres. Maintain a wide enough distance from these heavy vehicles while passing and do not try to pass between two heavy vehicles.
4. Children on two-wheelers need additional care. Make sure that children are also wearing a helmet. Do not keep the child in your lap or standing in front of you or on the petrol tank. Even a small jerk can cause them to fall. Try to get a safety harness for children.
5. Bicyclists should also follow the steps mentioned above of using helmets and visibility. An additional tip for bicyclists is to wear a reflective jacket for improved visibility and if possible, get some dynamo lights.

* Similarly, here are some safety tips for cars:

1. Your car may have ABS or Airbags or some other safety feature. However, the most important safety feature in a car is the seat belt. All other safety features in a car are designed assuming that the occupants are belted. Similar to the helmets, the purpose of wearing a seat belt is not to avoid a fine. Also, even the rear occupants should be wearing a seat belt. I have seen countless accidents in which the belted front occupants got severely injured just because the rear occupants crashed into them.
2. Order of car safety features in terms of importance: Seat belts with pretensioners>ABS>A strong car body>Airbags. If you can afford it, get a car with an Electronic Stability Program. Hold-off on ADAS for now. ADAS is not yet ready for Indian roads.
3. A couple of clarifications on the airbag: **Unless you have a high end car, Airbags will deploy even if you are not wearing a seat belt** and **An Airbag can kill you if you are not wearing a seat belt. An airbag is a controlled explosion**. The primary purpose of the airbag is to supplement the primary restraint system i.e. the seat belt. That is why your will find the initials **SRS** written on airbags.
4. Seat belts are for adults and can hurt children. Children in cars need an additional safety tool called as **Car seats** or **Child seats**. If you have a child in the family, get them a good quality car seats. Adults holding the child will not provide any protection. I have investigated too many crashes in which children have flown out of the adult's arms and hit the windshield or even been thrown out the car's windows.
5. Run a regular check for the vehicle's health. Especially the tyres.
6. Every car in India should have a dashboard camera or Dash Cam. It is not a safety tool per se. But, it is extremely important for your peace of mind. You never know when you might be wrongfully accused for causing an accident. Cops are notorious in getting ""settlements"" from car owners.

* As a pedestrian, stay as away from the road as possible while walking along the road. Always try to keep a barrier between yourself and the moving traffic. If unavoidable, always walk while facing the traffic. Do not make sudden moves while crossing the road. **Also, do not use your mobile phone while walking along or crossing the road.**
* Pedestrians should also be alert to sudden vehicle movements such as a vehicle reversing without any buzzer. Do not cross or walk too close to a heavy vehicle. The driver's in these vehicles are seated much higher and will not notice you. 
* If you are planning to get an electric vehicle, especially two-wheeler, go with a brand that has a good history of manufacturing vehicles. Too many brands have jumped into the fray of making electric vehicles. I am not saying that all the brands are bad. The thing is that designing a safe electric vehicle takes a lot of R&D and road tests. Many electric two-wheelers are prone to fires.
* **The most important tip: Although we celebrate Road Safety for just 1 week in a year, road accidents continue to kill Indians for the remaining 51 weeks. Follow good road safety practices throughout the year and stay safe.**

1921,"AMA Announcement: Séverine Bardon, film director and journalist. Her documentary ""India: The Children’s Newspaper” follows a newspaper written by and for street children from Delhi. Want to know about film-making and how Balaknama is changing children’s lives? Join the AMA on Nov 3rd, 6:30 PM IST","Greetings r/India,

We will be hosting journalist, film-maker Séverine Bardon in an AMA on Nov 3rd, 6:30 PM IST. On our request she sent us the following bio. Do check out the documentary linked at the end of the post.

#About Séverine:  
> I’m Séverine Bardon, a film director, journalist and producer whose documentaries have been shown on Arte, Canal Plus, France 2, France 5, France 24, France Ô and RTBF. I’ve created reportages on India, Kosovo, Indonesia, Cambodia and Myanmar and worked as a correspondent in China as well as as a Chinese-language translator. I've also written travel guides for Mongolia, Azerbaijan, China and Central Asia. In 2019 I travelled to New Delhi to film a documentary dedicated to a very special publication that is changing the lives of many underprivileged youngsters.

#About Balaknama:
> Founded in 2003, Balaknama, which translates as “The Voice of the Children,” is a newspaper staffed almost entirely by street children from Delhi’s slums, aged 10 to 17.

> The newspaper distributes around 8,000 copies, in Hindi and English, highlighting positive initiatives, but also publishes stories on police brutality, drug problems and forced labour.

> In fact, Balaknama’s reporting has already led the local authorities to take action on the subjects denounced in its pages.

> It has also changed the lives of its young reporters. For instance, Jyoti got rid of her drug addiction, and would like to continue helping children in difficulty, whereas 16-year-old Deepak has resumed his studies, and after years of working at a factory, would one day like to pursue a career as a TV presenter.

1930,"AMA Announcement: Arushi Garg (lecturer in criminal law at the University of Sheffield) & Riya Singh (part of core leadership group in India's single and largest Dalit women-led collective, Dalit Women Fight). The AMA will be about ongoing criminal reform process in India. 30th Oct, Friday, 6 PM IST","Hey r/India, we have an exciting AMA scheduled! This AMA will be about the ongoing criminal reform process in India. This process essentially involves the overhaul of the ENTIRE criminal justice system - including substantive, procedural and evidentiary laws - but is being completed in just six months in the middle of a pandemic. We should all be very worried about this. Criminal laws define what we can and cannot do without fear of punishment. The best example of this is the recently read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which criminalised same sex relations for centuries. Criminal laws also decide when the police can arrest you, how they treat you during detention and against what standards your guilt or innocence is measured in court. For example, in recognition of the pervasiveness of torture in Indian jails, confessions made to a police officer are usually not admissible in a court of law. This might change following the current reform exercise. Some of us are especially sceptical given that the Home Minister, in one of his earliest announcements about this process, upheld the UP Government as a progressive symbol of ‘law order.’ We have all seen how much the UP government cares about law and order in the recent Hathras horror, and in several other incidents.
 
To make things worse, the process is being carried out in the most opaque and exclusionary manner. The reform Committee’s processes are a big departure from how law reform is usually carried out in India and internationally. For example, the Committee’s entire business is being conducted only online, and only in English. Note that only about 36% of the country actively uses the internet (not even going into levels of internet literacy here…) and most estimates suggest that only about six to ten percent of the country speaks English as a first, second or third language. As far as we know all the Committee’s members are upper caste Hindu, straight, non-disabled, middle to upper class, cisgender men. Perhaps this partly explains why they are operating according to processes which most marginalised people in India don’t have access to. The Committee’s composition and operation has also raised concerns that they will not give due importance to the experience of marginalised groups in its deliberations. This is a crucial point because criminal laws are over-enforced over oppressed groups, who remain simultaneously under-protected from victimisation by the state as well as by third parties.
 
You can read more about the concerns here, including in several local Indian languages: https://disbandthecommittee.in/concerns.html
 
Please consider writing to your MP, Home Minister and Committee, demanding that they terminate this process immediately using this link: https://disbandthecommittee.in/mail.html

1934,"AMA announcement: Nakul Singh Sawhney, independent documentary filmmaker (Chalchitra Abhiyaan) @ 5:30 pm today.","Here is an introduction Nakul sent us! 

-----

Nakul Singh Sawhney is an independent documentary filmmaker. He has focused mainly on questions of labour rights, gender, caste and communalism. 

His prominent feature length films are Izzatnagari Ki Asabhya Betiyaan (Immoral Daughters in the Land of Honour) and Muzaffarnagar Baaqi Hai... (Muzaffarnagar Eventually...). Along with that he's also directed several short documentary films, including 'Kairana Surkhiyon ke Baad', 'Muavza' and 'Savitri's Sisters at Azadi Kooch'. 

His films have been screened at several important venues, across India and abroad, including at prestigious film festivals like Cinema of Resistance
and Film South Asia (Nepal), Mumbai International Film Festival, IDSFFK and
Minneapolis St. Paul International Film Festival. 

He then founded ChalChitra Abhiyaan in 2017. It is a film and media collective in Western Uttar Pradesh. With a committed team from local communities, the collective produces a range of video formats like documentary films, news features, interviews and live broadcasts. We try to bring to the fore local issues from the grassroots that concern different marginalised communities in their own voices. Issues that are often glossed over by the mainstream media because of corporate control, the stranglehold of strong political parties or caste, class, religious and gender biases. We train people from local communities to tell their own stories through videos.  Our stories are hyperlocal and the bulk of our audience is also from Western Uttar Pradesh (UP). Through our stories we have raised awareness about a range of local issues and also brought attention to local issues in the national media, alerting and pressurising local authorities to act. 

Since the videos are made by people from within the communities, there is solid engagement and belongingness towards each issues raised in the video. We take these videos offline to people in remotest parts of West UP through weekly screenings using projectors in village squares and initiate discussions and debate on topics raised. 
Attended by at least 100 people weekly, this has built a regular, large offline viewership in our target areas. 
We also disseminate the same videos through our online channels .

Youtube channel has 45k subscribers- https://www.youtube.com/c/ChalChitraAbhiyaan 

Facebook with 35,000 subscribers: https://m.facebook.com/ChalChitraAbhiyaan

We have a large scale Whatsapp distribution network that takes our videos to at least 2,000 viewers.

I recently watched some documentaries on animal agriculture, and came to find out that the milk industry is extremely cruel. 

All along ive been thinking that cows are treated like mothers and family members, and only the extra milk is taken. I only today realize that im all wrong. 

In india: Dairy cows are impregnated by a bull year after year. The calves are taken away and tied separately, not getting even a few minutes of time to bond with their mothers. This is very painful for the cow mothers and babies. Nose ropes are commonly used, though very painful and cruel. Bulls are generally overworked, and their lifespans are shortened. When cows are aged, they are usually abandoned or sold to slaughter- making india the second largest producer of beef. Male calves are sold off to work in fields or to slaughter as they age. 

I didn't even know that these things happened. I then thought these things only happened in beef eating western countries. I now know that this is common practice in india as well. 

I learned about the horrors of indian dairy- and im currently very disturbed. Am i the only one here?

Am i the only person who didn't know the cruelty behind milk products?",23,Food,"Flair_id    9d63ec2c-9301-11e6-8bc6-0e75e6e00470

And mind-boggling variety in the brands already here that often taste way better than their officially sold counterparts: Coke/Pepsi flavours, Cheetos/Pringles shit, even bloody Dairy Milk and KitKat. And even the same product and flavour tastes richer in the import version than in the Indian-made version.

Companies just don't bother with new products....I liked Sprite Zero way more than Coke Zero, and it was phased out. While Cadbury has some great stuff abroad, in India we get some n-th Dairy Milk Plain/Oreo branded abomination that's just sugar and regret, not even delicious junk food.

Most of these products are grey market imports with the price jacked up by third parties instead of those companies officially selling things here (even if, say, the cost of producing such foods in India is unjustified for these cos).

1996,Why meat consumption can’t be equated with language,"tl;dr - unsustainable meat consumption leads to environmental degradation, emissions, deforestation, hunger, slavery, zoonotic diseases, epidemics/pandemics, anti microbial resistance, etc.  


Let me start by saying that whenever one tries to have a conversation around meat consumption in India, one has to acknowledge the history of casteism. There is no denying the casteist connotations over here, and the learning for me has been it is natural for a person like me (UC Hindu) preaching vegetarianism to not be taken seriously in our nation given the history around caste and justifiably so. Hence folks like me need to check our privilege before preaching to others. I, and people like me, need to make an extra effort to make sure we aren’t weaponizing caste and definitely cannot look down on others who did not have the same privilege as us.

Let me provide what I consider to be logical arguments as to why vegetarianism (VT), not even veganism(VE), is better than non-vegetarianism(NV). Because if VT > NV then definitely VE is the best. Please for the sake of logic excuse my caste privilege here.

&#x200B;

A. Legal

VT isn’t legally superior to NV.

Legality follows practicality, morality and ethics, not the other way around.

It is illegal to smoke a joint. 

It is illegal for a 24 year old to have hard liquor in Maharashtra.

But it is legal to rape your wife!

In some parts of the world it is legal for the state to execute you for drawing the wrong person!

So legal superiority counts for shit.

&#x200B;

B. Moral or Ethical

Firstly, I agree being a Vegetarian doesn’t mean one is ethically superior to a non-vegetarian. But in most cases VT is superior to NV, given all else is equal.

Let us say 2 people belong to the same caste, creed, economic class, having the same environmental impact, using the same amount of animal products, both raised the same way, with the same food habits, same health conditions, same ability to digest meat, and are same in every other imaginable way. One of them is a meat eater, and the other isn’t, then obviously in **my view** the Vegetarian is more ethical.

I absolutely understand the aforementioned scenario is never possible, and never have I said that VT is the only way to be more ethical. You may pick your own thing.

All of us have our own definition of who is important, who is in our circle, who is work preserving, who is worth fighting for, who is worth dying for.

For me personally it follows this order

1. Humans I love

2. Humans I know

3. Children, innocents, etc within humanity

3. Animals I love and know, cute baby animals

4. Most of humanity(non Assholes) with a preference to people who are similar to me

5. Other animals

6. Reprehensible human beings

7. Literal vermins, mosquitos

I’d rather eat someone who believes Hitler/Mao were good than a puppy, kitten, calf,etc.

When it comes to social justice we expect all of us to be on board with the fact that all humans are the same. Black people aren’t naturally slaves or white folks aren’t naturally smart. And we expect all of us to be on board with this idea regardless of what one’s personal definition is of who is a human.

Now why can’t we extend the same to the animal kingdom?

A couple of centuries ago race based slavery was a given just like non vegetarianism is.

Good people could’ve been slave owners back in the day, just as much as good people can eat non veg today.

But that doesn’t mean the act of killing a living being for food is acceptable

Now let me come to why I said in **most cases** VT is superior to NV, not **all**.

Let us say person A consumes the meat of an already dead animal, or for that matter humanely hunts to feed their family.

Whereas person B is a VT, but who mistreats farm animals works them to death in the fields.

In **my view** unequivocally the meat eater is more ethical.

I have a Sikh friend who comes from a family of meat eaters (2\~3 times a week). He visited a slaughterhouse in his early teen years, and completely stopped eating meat afterwards.

This dude is 100% morally superior(in this regard) to me, a born VT who hasn’t even successfully quit milk! He’ll retain that superiority even if he indulges in one off ceremonial meat consumption, because he has made the change despite contradictory societal expectation.

But in both these cases, all else isn’t equal. Also, morality is, according to me, more a function of the intent than an act alone. While I did say in most cases VT is superior to NV, given all else is equal, preaching VT completely depends on the intent. Attempting to claim some superiority over something one had nothing to do with is morally reprehensible. Wanting humans to show more compassion towards other living beings is pretty moral.

Bottom line, ones morality can’t be gauged on the basis of ones dietary preferences, but certain dietary preferences definitely are more moral.

&#x200B;

C. Environment 

livestock — including cows, pigs, sheep and other animals — are responsible for about 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/

26 percent of the Planet’s ice-free land is used for livestock grazing and nearly a third of all croplands are used for livestock feed production

More than 40% of crop yields are diverted to livestock with an average feed conversion of less than 10%. Meaning grains which could feed 4 billion people is used to get animal products which can’t even feed 400 million. While nearly a billion people go hungry around the world.

Plus run offs from slaughterhouses getting absorbed by the soil or seeping Into water sources leads to massive environmental degradation.

So in a nutshell vegetarianism will help curb emissions, deforestation, hunger.

&#x200B;

D. Medical

The close proximity in which animals are kept in factory farms, slaughter houses and wet markets can lead to diseases jumping over from one host to another, which can be a cause of a future pandemic of zoonotic origin.

Then there is the issue of animals being pumped with antibiotics. Excessive use can lead to anti microbial resistance among humans, which may cost us a century of advancement in Medicine (at least back to the days before penicillin)

  
‘Now here are responses to some standard comments:

1. Even plants have feelings, what about the bacteria?

I agree, if my definition of living beings which matter can include non-human mammals, birds, fishes, etc. why can't someone else's include plants, micro organisms, viruses, etc.

I'd imagine there would be 2 types of people in this bracket:

i. Those who truly care about every being

ii. Those who absolutely do not care for any beings outside of the human race 

Some tenets of Jainism might be useful for folks in the (i) category

For the ones belonging to category (ii), please focus on the practical arguments against animal consumption like climate change, world hunger, slavery in meat packing and fisheries industry, neo-colonialism by Chinese and the Europeans, Pandemics, anti-microbial resistance, etc.

Also, this argument reeks a little of Absolutism

Just because there is no way I can feed myself without causing harm so let me cause as much harm as possible!

We need to maintain a balance with our ecosystem. The problem is not meat consumption but unsustainable meat consumption.

Plus there is the trophic value (i.e. Only about 10% of the nutritional value passes up the food chain). So consuming plants directly makes much more sense than things which consume plants.

2. Humans are Omnivores

I agree, I too have elongated canines. I am not arguing for immediate cessation of meat consumption across the world. But to use evolution in this argument, and this argument alone doesn't seem justified. What humans eat has drastically changed more than once since before the dawn of agriculture. While there is agreement on Humans being omnivores, there still is a lot of debate on the percentage of meat vs berries, plants, fruits, etc. and none of the sources I have across even state that it was mostly meat. If anything it is the other way around with meat being secondary and plant based sources being primary.

And never in the history of humanity are we consuming as much processed food as today, animal based or plant based.

So whatever humans ate in the past, we no longer eat. If our internal organs were incompatible with a plant based diet I'd take your point.

3. Tandoori Chicken is tasty

Yes, I know. That is precisely why I am asking you to save some for the future generations.

Waise, just wanted to add that what you are eating isn't even chicken, not the same one when the recipe was first used.

Chickens used to live 20 years and weigh less than a kg half a century back. Now they live just for a few weeks and weigh 5 times as much!

Also, rather than going cold turkey, one can merely reduce consumption, only consume meat from sustainable sources, switch to artificial meat once it becomes commercially viable, etc.

4. You are a Bhakt

I addressed this in the 1st para itself. I understand how a UC Hindu preaching vegetarianism in India can be seen having obvious caste undertones. This person who was born a vegetarian is preaching to our lot on changing our habits, he doesn't have to give anything up!

Plus its not like vegetarians cant do better. Veganism exists. There is no point in revering cows if you use leather!

Plus industrial milching of cows is worse for the environment than sustainable consumption of some meats",0,Food,"Flair_id    9d63ec2c-9301-11e6-8bc6-0e75e6e00470

2001,Swiggy Delivery Executive Scam,"Anyone with contacts with swiggy please forward this. I hope this helps swiggy in hiring and maintaining better delivery executive. Below is the mail I wrote to them.

&#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello,

I just want to make sure you are aware of the frauds that are happening recently by your delivery executives.

What made me write this email is that this happened to me multiple times in the last few months and this time I had proof.

Coming to the point. I made an order on swiggy from BurgerKing on 26/02/2022 at 11:47pm Order# 128974641313. At around 1:00 am I get a call from the helpline saying that the delivery executive has met with an accident and won't be able to deliver my order. After asking to connect me with the executive, I asked the delivery guy if I can personally come and pick up the order from him at his location. He denied saying that the order is completely ruined and he is on his way to the hospital.

Upon further asking him to provide me with pictures of the scene, He sent me this image(attached with the mail). You can clearly see that the order is in perfect condition except that he took the order out from the bag and neatly placed it on the ground.

Proof 1 - The Choco lava cake is literally upright and the box that it came with is upside down. Weird isn't it?

Proof 2 - Burger is neatly placed outside the box with no signs of damage. Accidents won't leave such fragile products with zero damage.

Proof 3 - The fries inside the 3rd box are not at all damaged?

How is everything outside the packaging but with zero signs of damage?

Even after asking him to provide me with pictures of the accident or himself. He didn't reply back at all.

I hope someone from the support department actually sees this email and it's not just lost otherwise.

I did not want to write this email but I had to because YOU LOST A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER TODAY swiggy.

I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else in the future.

With not so warm regards,

Sarthak Mishra

When I moved east(inland) in the same state, my college hostel had non-veg food available, which would be crazy where I come from. Hostels would announce prior that they're a non-veg hostel. But this one claimed to be vegetarian, but after admission told me non-veg us available twice a week.

I had hard time finding Vegetarian restaurants also. Even though they exist, they're not easy to find. Because in my native district, it's common to label restaurants as"" veg"" or ""non-veg"". But in the inland Karnataka, veg hotels are labelled ""pure veg"" while non-veg hotels are labelled ""veg and non-veg"" and if it's not labelled, and I go in, ask them if it's a veg hotel, they'd say yes. But there's non-veg food available too..

And to my shock, when I went to Kerala, hotels don't even label if they're veg or non-veg, almost every hotel is non-veg, which is crazy to me...

Grabbing a quick Mexican/Thai/American sounds yummy and works out for less than $10 a meal usually but as an Indian, one gets back to craving homemade Indian food after a while, add to that, equivalent portion Indian meals cost over $15 a meal so not cost effective.

2034,Why are Indians so defensive about vegetarianism?,"Hi all, I’m Indian by birth but spent pretty much all my life in Singapore, USA and Canada. 

Recently, I was having a conversation with a first gen immigrant to Toronto from a vegetarian community(I think Agrawal or Jain, something like that not too sure). 

I merely suggested that it’s easier to put on muscle while lifting if you eat meat and he immediately started ranting about how the vegetarian diet is superior and that meat eating is completely against our nature blah blah. 

I didn’t want to offend him or keep arguing so I toned my argument down a bit by saying it’s still possible to get necessary protein intake in plant form. 

But I don’t get the need to be so defensive about it? As I understand, most Indians eat meat right?",193,Food,"Flair_id    9d63ec2c-9301-11e6-8bc6-0e75e6e00470

2038,Talk with a young farmer from Andhra Pradesh.,"I met this young farmer from Andhra last week while having a smoke in a bakery in Bangalore. He asked for the lighter and we had a convo. He told me he had come to Bangalore for selling his produce for a wholesaler and to roam the city for a few days.  He farmed Pomegranates and some other fruits in his land, Told me how drip irrigation works and how they have very little water to use for farming. He was an engineering graduate from Hyderabad and had gone into his father's business of agriculture.

But the later conversation shocked me when I asked him it would've been amazing to eat the fruits directly from the farm. He told that there are 5 different qualities for his produce and the lowest ones are supplied throughout these villages and semi-urban areas. The first 2 qualities get exported to different countries. So literally we are eating shit that is not considered edible by most of these developed countries.

and he told me he never takes any fruits from his farm ground and he maintains a farm for his family in a small land that is not treated with pesticides. He told me openly that he can't do anything without pesticides and organic farming never gives such yield. 

He told me how there is a price chosen by these big wholesalers to create demand and scarcity for particular vegetables and other products. 

Coincidentally I had ordered a pomegranate juice from the same bakery and left it half-finished.",152,Food,"Flair_id    9d63ec2c-9301-11e6-8bc6-0e75e6e00470

2039,So I just had Tikka Masala for the first time...,"And it was AWESOME.  I've eaten several Indian dishes but they were mostly vegetarian.

How does butter chicken compare to tikka masala?  I am originally from NY and the masala tasted like a richer vodka sauce.

Apologies if this has been posted here before but we finally have a legit Indian restaurant in our town and I want to take advantage of all that your cuisine has to offer.

2042,Unpopular Opinion: Overuse of Spices does not make food tasty,"I have seen this trend everywhere in India, right from home to restaurants to dhabbas. The moment someone wants to make a dish ""tasty"", they will end up bombarding it with spices, especially chilli powder.

Even companies end up overusing the masala in any new snack that they release.

I have sensitive taste buds & generally prefer to have less spicy or bland food so even with medium spicy food I end up sweating profusely. 

Considering most Indians are obsessed with spices, this may be an unpopular opinion but please use spices judiciously, there are other flavours in the taste palette.",107,Food,"Flair_id    9d63ec2c-9301-11e6-8bc6-0e75e6e00470

 Recently I have been Noticing these Biscuits have been getting sweeter and sweeter in a bad way and loosing the original taste they had, Not Just the Taste but the consistency and the quality of Maida they use in it too.
Good day has lost every piece if dry fruit that it used to filled with, Parle-G and Tiger Feels like eating a spoonful of Sugar instead of Biscuits.
The line was crossed when after a long-time i got krack-jack and I remember it being a sweet-salty kinda taste and to my suprise it too was so sweet i left the packet alone.
